# Operational Frameworks — Content Frameworks

## Overview

This document contains generic frameworks for creating social media content. Each framework is a reusable template with `{{VARIABLE}}` placeholders. Frameworks are divided into 3 categories:
- **L1-L8**: LinkedIn Frameworks (text posts)
- **V1-V6**: Video Frameworks (Reels/TikTok)
- **S1-S3**: Strategic Frameworks (cross-platform)

For brand-specific examples, see `brands/[your-brand]/framework-examples.md`.

## LinkedIn Frameworks (L1-L8)

### L1 — The Surprising Data Point
*(inspired by: Neil Patel, Luca La Mesa, Veronica Gentili)*

**When to use**: you have a statistic that challenges your target audience's expectations.
**Recommended pillars**: TOFU, education
**Brand level**: 0-1 (absent or implicit)

**Template**:
```
{{SURPRISING_DATA}}.

{{SIMPLE_TRANSLATION}} — what this actually means in practice.

{{CONTEXT}} (2-3 lines explaining why this data matters)

{{INSIGHT}} — the lesson no one tells you.

{{OPEN_QUESTION}} — what do you think? Can you relate?

{{HASHTAGS}}
```

**Example** (B2B SaaS — project management):
```
68% of software projects fail not because of technical issues, but because of communication problems.

In plain English: 7 out of 10 projects that fail didn't have a bug in the code. They had a bug in the process.

In a team of 15 people, that means at least 10 meetings per week that serve no purpose. Duplicate tasks. Information lost between email and Slack. Deadlines nobody knew existed.

The problem isn't the team. It's the way they collaborate.

What about you? How many hours per week do you waste due to misalignment? Be honest in the comments.

### L2 — The Before vs After
*(inspired by: Russell Brunson, Brendan Kane, Chiara Dosio)*

**When to use**: you want to showcase a transformation (product result or process change).
**Recommended pillars**: case study, BOFU
**Brand level**: 3 (case study)

**Template**:
```
Before: {{BEFORE_SITUATION}}.
After: {{AFTER_SITUATION}}.

{{BRIEF_CONTEXT}} — what changed and why.

{{DETAIL_1}}
{{DETAIL_2}}
{{DETAIL_3}}

{{LESSON}} — what you can learn from this case.

{{SOFT_CTA}}

{{HASHTAGS}}
```

**Example** (B2B SaaS — customer support):
```
Before: 200 tickets. 3-day average wait time. 45% satisfaction.
After: 200 tickets. 2-hour average response time. 92% satisfaction.

Same team. Same customers. Same products. The only difference: how they handled requests.

→ Before: everything via email, manual responses. Agents searched for solutions from scratch every time
→ After: knowledge base + AI suggesting responses. Agents review and personalize
→ Result: average resolution time dropped from 72 hours to 4

Technology doesn't change customers. It changes how fast you help them.

### L3 — The Practical List (How-To)
*(inspired by: Brian Dean, Ann Handley, Julia McCoy)*

**When to use**: you want to educate your audience with practical, immediately actionable tips.
**Recommended pillars**: education, MOFU
**Brand level**: 0-1 (absent or implicit)

**Template**:
```
{{NUMBER_HOOK}} — {{VALUE_PROMISE}}.

{{INTRO}} (1-2 lines of context)

1. {{TIP_1}}
→ {{EXPLANATION_1}}

2. {{TIP_2}}
→ {{EXPLANATION_2}}

3. {{TIP_3}}
→ {{EXPLANATION_3}}

4. {{TIP_4}}
→ {{EXPLANATION_4}}

5. {{TIP_5}}
→ {{EXPLANATION_5}}

{{CLOSING}} — which one will you try first?

{{HASHTAGS}}
```

---

### L4 — The Uncomfortable Question
*(inspired by: Gianluca Diegoli, Seth Godin, Riccardo Scandellari)*

**When to use**: you want to provoke reflection and generate comments.
**Recommended pillars**: TOFU, thought leadership
**Brand level**: 0 (absent)

**Template**:
```
{{UNCOMFORTABLE_QUESTION}}

{{PAUSE}} (empty line — let the question breathe)

{{CONTEXT}} — why this question matters (3-4 lines)

{{PROVOCATION}} — the answer nobody wants to hear.

{{OPENING}} — but it could be different. Here's how.

What do you think? {{SPECIFIC_QUESTION_FOR_COMMENTS}}

{{HASHTAGS}}
```

**Example** (B2B SaaS — marketing automation):
```
If your email strategy is identical to what it was 5 years ago, why do you expect different open rates?

The market has changed. Customers have changed. Inboxes have changed. Attention spans have changed.

But in too many companies, email marketing still works like this: list → template → blast send → hope for the best.

It's nobody's fault. It's inertia. And inertia is the silent enemy of marketing.

The good news: you don't need a revolution. Just change ONE piece of the process to see different results.

What's the one piece of YOUR email strategy you'd change first? Drop it in the comments.

### L5 — The Narrative Case Study
*(inspired by: Donald Miller, Luca La Mesa, Chris Walker)*

**When to use**: you have a real case (client or situation) to tell in narrative form.
**Recommended pillars**: BOFU, case study
**Brand level**: 3 (case study)

**Template**:
```
{{ANONYMOUS_NAME}} had a problem: {{SPECIFIC_PROBLEM}}.

{{COMPANY_CONTEXT}} (size, industry, situation — 2-3 lines)

They had tried {{PREVIOUS_SOLUTIONS}}. It didn't work because {{REASON}}.

Then {{WHAT_CHANGED}}.

Results:
→ {{RESULT_1}}
→ {{RESULT_2}}
→ {{RESULT_3}}

The lesson: {{UNIVERSAL_INSIGHT}}.

{{CTA_OR_QUESTION}}

{{HASHTAGS}}
```

---

### L6 — Personal Storytelling (Founders)
*(inspired by: Gary Vaynerchuk, Marco Montemagno, Mark Schaefer)*

**When to use**: founders share a personal experience, a lesson learned, a startup moment.
**Recommended pillars**: brand, behind the scenes
**Brand level**: 2 (mention)

**Template**:
```
{{PERSONAL_OPENING}} — a specific moment, a memory, an emotion.

{{CONTEXT}} (what was happening — 2-3 lines)

{{DEVELOPMENT}} — what happened next, what I realized.

{{LESSON}} — the reflection I carry with me.

{{BRAND_CONNECTION}} — how this experience shaped our approach (subtle, not promotional).

{{PERSONAL_QUESTION}} — has something like this ever happened to you?

{{HASHTAGS}}
```

---

### L7 — The Contrarian Take
*(inspired by: Rand Fishkin, Gianluca Diegoli, Rudy Bandiera)*

**When to use**: you want to express an opinion that goes against industry consensus.
**Recommended pillars**: thought leadership, TOFU
**Brand level**: 0-1 (absent or implicit)

**Template**:
```
Unpopular opinion: {{CONTRARIAN_OPINION}}.

{{WHY_EVERYONE_THINKS_OTHERWISE}} (2-3 lines)

But here's what the data says: {{DATA_OR_EVIDENCE}}.

{{ARGUMENT}} — why my opinion is grounded (3-4 lines)

{{OPENING}} — I'm not saying {{COMMON_POSITION}} is wrong. I'm saying it's not the only answer.

Agree or disagree? Make your case in the comments.

{{HASHTAGS}}
```

---

### L8 — The Shared Frustration (INFOTAINMENT)
*(infotainment framework — inspired by: Mirko Pallera, Rudy Bandiera, Dario Vignali)*

**When to use**: you want to drive engagement through identification with a daily frustration your audience experiences.
**Recommended pillars**: infotainment, MOFU
**Brand level**: 1 (implicit)

**Template**:
```
Raise your hand if {{RELATABLE_SITUATION}}.

{{IRONIC_EXPANSION}} (2-3 lines amplifying the absurdity of the situation)

{{SPECIFIC_DETAIL}} — that one detail so specific that anyone who lives it can't help but relate.

And then someone tells you: "{{LINE_YOUR_AUDIENCE_HATES_HEARING}}."

{{IRONIC_CLOSING}} — the truth everyone thinks but nobody says.

Tag that colleague who knows EXACTLY what I'm talking about.

{{HASHTAGS}}
```

**Example** (B2B SaaS — sales):
```
Raise your hand if you've ever prepared a perfect demo and the prospect didn't show up.

Demo prepared. Slides updated. CRM filled in. 15 minutes early on the call. Timer running. Nobody joins.

And the best part: they wrote you "Can't wait!" the day before.

And then the sales manager asks: "So, how did the demo go?" You: "Great." (No. Nobody showed up.)

The truth? The problem isn't the no-show. It's that nobody qualified that lead before making you work it.

Tag that colleague who knows EXACTLY what I'm talking about.

## Strategic Frameworks (S1-S3)

### S1 — The TOFU-MOFU-BOFU Weekly Framework
*(from Joe Pulizzi, Chris Walker, Russell Brunson)*

**Rule**: every week must cover the full funnel.

| Funnel | % of content | Goal | Content type |
|--------|-------------|------|--------------|
| **TOFU** | 30% | Attract new followers, awareness | Data, trends, opinions |
| **MOFU** | 40% | Educate, build trust, engagement | How-to, lists, infotainment |
| **BOFU** | 20% | Convert, demo, trial | Case studies, before/after |
| **BRAND** | 10% | Humanize, build loyalty | Storytelling, behind the scenes |

### S2 — The Content Distribution Framework
*(from Gary Vaynerchuk, Marco Montemagno, Alessio Beltrami)*

**Rule**: 1 pillar piece of content → many micro-contents.

```
1 LONG-FORM VIDEO (5-10 min, YouTube/LinkedIn)
    ↓
3-5 SHORT CLIPS (15-30s, Reels/TikTok)
    ↓
1 LINKEDIN POST (text, reworked from the topic)
    ↓
3-5 GRAPHICS (data, quotes, for LinkedIn/Instagram)
    ↓
1 NEWSLETTER (deep dive for subscribers)
```

One weekly theme → 10+ pieces of content across different platforms.

### S3 — The Zero-Click Framework
*(from Rand Fishkin)*

**Rule**: every piece of content must deliver COMPLETE value on the platform. Zero teasers, zero "learn more on our website."

| Click-bait | Zero-Click |
|---|---|
| "5 common mistakes → read the article on our blog" | "5 common mistakes: 1. ... 2. ... 3. ... 4. ... 5. ..." (all in the post) |
| "How does [feature] work? Find out on our site" | "How [feature] works: [full explanation in the post]" |
| "Incredible results → link in bio" | "The actual results: [data and explanation in the post]" |

Complete content builds trust → trust generates organic leads → organic leads convert better.

# 05 — Video Playbook (Script & Storyboard)

## Technical Specifications

### Reels Format (Instagram)
- **Optimal duration**: 15-30 seconds (sweet spot for reach)
- **Max recommended duration**: 60 seconds
- **Aspect ratio**: 9:16 (vertical)
- **Resolution**: 1080x1920 px
- **Text safe zone**: avoid top 250px (username) and bottom 400px (CTA/comments)
- **Subtitles**: always. 70%+ watch without sound
- **Cover**: clear frame with readable text for the feed

### TikTok Format
- **Optimal duration**: 15-45 seconds
- **Max recommended duration**: 60 seconds (up to 3 min possible but not recommended for this content type)
- **Aspect ratio**: 9:16 (vertical)
- **Resolution**: 1080x1920 px
- **Text safe zone**: similar to Reels — avoid top and bottom
- **Subtitles**: always
- **Trending sounds**: use when relevant to the content (don't force it)

### Cross-posting Reels ↔ TikTok
- **Yes**: the same video can go on both platforms
- **No**: don't post with TikTok watermark on Instagram (and vice versa)
- **Adjustments**:
  - TikTok: can be slightly more informal, more trend-driven
  - Reels: slightly more polished, fewer ephemeral trends
  - Subtitles must be repositioned for each platform's safe zone

## The Complete Script Format

Every [your brand] video script includes 5 layers of information:

### 1. VISUAL (what you see)
- Framing: close-up, medium shot, wide shot, detail shot
- Speaker's facial expressions (crucial for infotainment)
- Props: physical objects used in the scene (pile of resumes, laptop, phone)
- Overlaid graphics, animations
- Transitions: hard cut, zoom, swipe

### 2. AUDIO (what you hear — exact dialogue)
- The word-for-word text spoken by the speaker
- Tone of voice: specific cues (ironic, serious, surprised, exasperated)
- Pacing: fast, pause, emphasis on keywords

### 3. ON-SCREEN TEXT (overlaid text)
- Text that appears on screen
- Position: top, center, bottom
- Font: consistent with brand (bold, sans-serif)
- Timing: when it appears and disappears

### 4. DIRECTING (production notes)
- Cuts: where to cut between scenes
- Zoom: zoom in for emphasis, zoom out for context
- Editing pace: fast (cuts every 2-3 seconds to maintain attention)
- Special transitions (if needed)

### 5. MUSIC/SFX (background audio)
- Music: trending audio, beat, strategic silence
- SFX: impact sounds, "ding", comedic sound, dramatic sound
- Volume: low under speech, high during non-speech moments

## The Hook in the First 3 Seconds

### Why the First 3 Seconds Are Everything
The viewer decides whether to keep watching in 1-3 seconds. If the hook doesn't work, everything else is wasted. Initial watch time determines algorithmic distribution.

### 5 Video Hook Techniques

**Technique 1: Visual Pattern Interrupt**
An unexpected visual element that breaks the feed scroll.
- Sudden movement (jumping up, turning around, slamming something on the desk)
- Strong facial expression (shock, exasperation, huge smile)
- Out-of-context object (enormous pile of papers, absurd sign, countdown)
- Unexpected color/lighting

**Technique 2: Curiosity-Driven Opening Line**
The first sentence must create an "open loop" the viewer wants to close.
- "You'll never guess what our ATS did yesterday"
- "The best candidate was in the one resume I hadn't read"
- "I have a confession: I don't read all the resumes"

**Technique 3: Pre-emptive On-Screen Text**
Text appears BEFORE the speaker starts talking, building anticipation.
- "200 resumes. 3 hours. Zero candidates lost."
- "POV: you're an HR on Monday morning"
- "Manual screening in 2026?"

**Technique 4: Direct-to-Camera Question**
The speaker looks at the camera and asks a question that immediately engages.
- "How many resumes did you read this week?"
- "Do you know how many candidates your ATS rejected without you knowing?"
- "Have you ever wondered why you can't find the right candidates?"

**Technique 5: "If..." Scenario**
Start with an "if" the target audience can't ignore.
- "If you've also spent 3 weeks on 200 resumes, this video is for you"
- "If your CEO has ever told you 'how long does it take?', keep watching"
- "If you think manual screening is the only option... sit down"

## The Infotainment Style in Video

### The Emotional Arc

```
SETUP (0-5s)        → Frustration/Recognition
                      "The viewer thinks: oh god, that's me"

DEVELOPMENT (5-15s) → Ironic Escalation
                      "The situation gets worse. The absurdity grows"

PAYOFF (15-25s)     → Smart Solution / Plot twist
                      "The viewer thinks: oh, there's a better way"

CTA (25-30s)        → Soft Call to Action
                      "Follow us / Link in bio / Save for later"
```

### The Viewer Should Think:
1. **"Oh god, that's me"** → shares out of solidarity
2. **"I'm smarter than that"** → shares for positioning
3. **"I need to show this to [name]"** → shares for connection
4. **"I didn't know that"** → saves for later

### Performance Guidelines for Founders

**Marta (primary video speaker)**:
- Look at the camera as if talking to a colleague, not an audience
- Natural expressions, not rehearsed
- Short pauses for emphasis (1-2 seconds of silence = extremely powerful)
- Ironic smirk > forced laugh
- Hands visible (natural Italian gesturing)
- Minor mistakes are fine: imperfection is authentic

**Michele (secondary speaker, tech focus)**:
- Calmer but enthusiastic tone
- Show the screen when explaining the technology
- "Watch what happens when..." + real demo
- Genuine excitement about the technology comes through

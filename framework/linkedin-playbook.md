# 04 — LinkedIn Playbook

## Platform Rules

### LinkedIn Algorithm (2026)
1. **The first 90 minutes decide everything**: engagement in the first 1.5 hours determines distribution
2. **Comments are worth more than likes**: one comment = 5-10x the value of a like for the algorithm
3. **External links get penalized**: posts with links in the body get ~40% less reach. Put links in comments
4. **Dwell time matters**: longer posts that hold the reader's attention get rewarded
5. **Conversations amplify**: when you reply to comments within 1 hour, the algorithm pushes the post
6. **Carousels and documents** get high reach (native format)
7. **Native videos** get decent reach, but lower than well-written text posts
8. **Reposts** get very low reach. Leave a valuable comment instead of reposting

### Optimal Posting Times (CET)
| Day | Best time | Good time |
|-----|-----------|-----------|
| Monday | 8:00-9:00 | 12:30-13:30 |
| Tuesday | 8:00-9:00 | 12:30-13:30 |
| Wednesday | 8:00-9:00 | 17:00-18:00 |
| Thursday | 8:00-9:00 | 12:30-13:30 |
| Friday | 8:00-9:00 | 12:00-13:00 |

**Note**: adjust posting times to your audience's timezone and habits. Professionals typically check LinkedIn during their morning commute and lunch break.

### Optimal Length
- **Text post**: 800-1300 characters (the sweet spot for dwell time without losing attention)
- **Hook**: first visible line without "see more" = max 140-150 characters
- **Paragraphs**: max 2-3 lines per paragraph. Blank lines between paragraphs
- **CTA**: 1 per post. Clear, natural

### Hashtag Strategy

**Primary hashtags** (use in every post, rotate 3-5):
- #HR
- #HumanResources
- #Recruiting
- #TalentAcquisition
- #SMB

**Secondary hashtags** (use when relevant):
- #AIRecruiting
- #HRTech
- #CVScreening
- #HRManager
- #Hiring
- #TalentAcquisition
- #CandidateExperience

**Brand hashtags** (use in Level 2-4 posts):
- #[your brand]

**Hashtag rules**:
- Max 3-5 per post (too many = spam for the algorithm)
- Place them at the end of the post, not in the body
- Never use irrelevant hashtags to inflate reach

## [your brand] LinkedIn Post Structure

### Anatomy of a Post

```
[HOOK — first line, visible without "see more"]
↑ Must stop the scroll. 140-150 characters max

[BLANK LINE]

[BODY — the valuable content]
Short paragraphs (2-3 lines)
Blank lines between paragraphs
Bullet lists where appropriate
Specific numbers and data

[BLANK LINE]

[CTA — natural call to action]
Open question to prompt comments
OR pointer to the link in comments

[BLANK LINE]

[HASHTAGS — 3-5, at the end]
```

### Hook Types (first line)

**Data hook**:
- "72% of recruiters don't have time to read every CV."
- "3 weeks. 200 CVs. 0 convincing candidates."

**Question hook**:
- "If your screening process is the same as 10 years ago, why do you expect different results?"
- "What's the real cost of a bad hire?"

**Frustration hook**:
- "Raise your hand if your ATS has ever rejected a qualified candidate."
- "Monday morning. 200 CVs on your desk. The CEO wants names by Friday."

**Opinion hook**:
- "Unpopular opinion: keyword matching has done more damage than good to recruiting."
- "The problem with recruiting in SMBs isn't the candidates. It's the process."

**Story hook**:
- "Last week we found a candidate who had been rejected 3 times."
- "When I started working in HR, manual screening seemed normal."

### Formatting

**Do**:
- Use blank lines to separate concepts
- Use bullet points with → or • for key points
- Use specific numbers (not "many" but "200")
- Use quotation marks for quotes
- Use bold sparingly (max 2-3 per post — LinkedIn supports it with **text**)

**Don't**:
- Walls of text with no breaks
- Emoji as decoration (max 1-2 functional ones: →, 📊)
- ALL CAPS SCREAMING
- Hashtags in the body text
- Links in the body

## Engagement Strategy

### Responding to Comments
- **Within 1 hour** of posting: reply to ALL comments
- **Valuable replies**: not just "thanks!" — add a data point, an anecdote, a question
- **Tag relevant people** when appropriate (no spam, only when genuine)
- Replies to comments = new content that the algorithm distributes

### Commenting on Other People's Posts
- 5-10 valuable comments per day on posts from HR influencers in your niche
- Long comments (3+ lines) with your own insight, not just "great post!"
- This drives visibility to the [your brand] profile without publishing

### Company Page vs Personal Profiles
- **Personal profiles (founders/team)**: main posts come from personal profiles (reach is 5-10x higher)
- **[your brand] company page**: selective reposts + institutional content (features, news, jobs)
- **Rule**: 80% of content from personal profiles, 20% from the company page

## Pre-Publishing Quality Checklist

### Content Check
- [ ] Hook: does it capture attention in 140 characters?
- [ ] Body: does it deliver genuine value (even without [your brand])?
- [ ] Data: is it specific and verifiable?
- [ ] Brand voice: is it consistent with `brand-voice.md`?
- [ ] Tone: is it infotainment (not corporate, not fluff)?
- [ ] Is the hero the reader (not [your brand])?
- [ ] Does [your brand] emerge naturally (when present)?

### Format Check
- [ ] No links in the body?
- [ ] Short paragraphs (max 2-3 lines)?
- [ ] Blank lines between paragraphs?
- [ ] Max 3-5 hashtags at the end?
- [ ] Max 1-2 functional emoji?
- [ ] Clear and natural CTA?
- [ ] Length 800-1300 characters?

### Strategy Check
- [ ] Is the pillar appropriate for the day of the week?
- [ ] Is the [your brand] level consistent with the distribution (65% absent/implicit)?
- [ ] Is the target persona identified?
- [ ] Is the funnel stage clear (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU)?

---

## Posting Frequency

**Minimum**: 3 posts/week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
**Optimal**: 5 posts/week (Monday-Friday)
**Maximum**: 1 post/day (more = cannibalization)

Consistency beats volume. 3 excellent posts per week for 1 year beats 7 mediocre posts for 3 months every time.

## Launch Post Strategy (Promoting a Project/Product)

This section gathers best practices from analyzing viral LinkedIn posts for launching open-source projects, AI tools, and side projects (research February 2026).

### Key Principles

**1. Build in Public > Cold Announcement**
Tell the *why* and the *how* behind what you built. Your audience connects with the journey, not the product. "I spent X weeks studying Y" beats "Launching my new tool" every time.

**2. Personal Hook + Specific Number**
Posts that open with something like "I studied 60 world-class experts" or concrete metrics perform far better than a generic "Unpopular opinion." The first line must stop the scroll with something specific and human.

**3. Proof > Claims**
Show the real work: repo screenshots, project structure, actual names. The tech audience recognizes and appreciates transparency. A claim without proof is noise.

**4. Comments Are Worth 2x Likes**
For the LinkedIn algorithm, a comment weighs twice as much as a like. Your CTA should provoke long, genuine responses — not a "nice post!"

**Weak CTAs** (binary answers):
- "Agree or disagree?"
- "Like if you also..."

**Strong CTAs** (elaborate answers):
- "How do you handle X? Single prompts, paid tools, or do you have your own system?"
- "What's the one part of your process you'd change first?"

**5. The First 60-90 Minutes Decide Everything**
Reply to EVERY comment in the first hour. The algorithm measures interaction speed and decides in this window whether to push the post or let it die.

**6. Carousel/PDF > Single Image > Text Only**
Native documents (PDF carousels) increase dwell time and have the highest reach. For a launch post, 3-4 slides with a visual breakdown of the project work better than an AI-generated image.

### Optimal Launch Post Structure

```
[HOOK — personal story + specific number]
"I studied/built/analyzed {{X}} over {{TIME_PERIOD}}. Here's what I found."

[BLANK LINE]

[CONTEXT — the why, the personal motivation]
Not for {{OBVIOUS_GOAL}} — for {{DEEPER_REAL_GOAL}}.

[BLANK LINE]

[RESULT — what you built, with specific numbers]
→ {{NUMBER}} + {{THING}}
→ {{NUMBER}} + {{THING}}
→ {{NUMBER}} + {{THING}}
→ Setup/cost/time: {{CONCRETE_DETAIL}}

[BLANK LINE]

[INSIGHT — the key lesson, the "what I realized"]
The problem is never {{THE_OBVIOUS_THING}}. It's {{THE_NON_OBVIOUS_THING}}.

[BLANK LINE]

[ACCESSIBILITY — remove the barriers]
It's not a {{EXPENSIVE_THING}}. It's a {{ACCESSIBLE_THING}}.

[BLANK LINE]

[CTA — open question that invites long replies]
Link in comments.
{{QUESTION}} — I'm curious to hear your take.

[HASHTAGS — 3-5, at the end]
```

### Winning Hook Patterns for Launch Posts

| Pattern | Example | Why it works |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Number + unexpected action** | "I studied 60 world-class experts. Then I coded them into a git repo" | Specific, sparks curiosity, breaks expectations |
| **Time invested + result** | "3 months of research. 14 templates. A system anyone can use for free" | Shows effort, the "free" part surprises |
| **Personal before/after** | "A year ago I wrote every post from scratch. Today I type /linkedin-post" | Concrete transformation, the reader pictures themselves in your shoes |
| **Contrarian + data** | "The perfect prompt doesn't exist. I have the data to prove it" | Challenges consensus, promises proof |

### What NOT to Do in a Launch Post

| Mistake | Why | Alternative |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Delaying the announcement | The reader loses interest if they can't tell what you're talking about right away | Put the "what" in the hook, the "why" in the body |
| Listing features | Nobody reads a feature list | Show the benefit to the user |
| No social proof | Without proof, it's just an opinion | Screenshots, numbers, real names |
| Vague CTA | "Learn more" doesn't drive action | "Link in comments" + specific question |
| Generic AI images | The tech audience spots them and scrolls past | Real screenshots, carousels, project diagrams |
| Links in the body | LinkedIn penalizes external links in the text (~40% less reach) | Always use "link in comments" |

### Launch Post Timing

- **Best day**: Monday or Tuesday 8:00-9:00 CET (first premium slot of the week)
- **Never on weekends**: LinkedIn engagement drops sharply on Saturday-Sunday
- **Space out your posts**: if you have 3 variants, publish them Monday-Wednesday-Friday
- **Prepare your replies**: in the first 60-90 minutes after publishing, you need to be available to respond to every comment

## Carousel Strategy (Document Posts)

LinkedIn carousels are PDF documents uploaded as native posts. Users swipe through slides directly in the feed. They are the format with the highest dwell time and among the best for engagement rate.

### Why Carousels Work

- **Average engagement rate**: ~6.1% (higher than single images, videos, text)
- **Dwell time**: users swipe through slides → the algorithm registers time spent → distribution boost
- **Multi-image**: multi-image posts reach up to 6.6% engagement
- **Completion rate**: a good carousel maintains a 60%+ completion rate
- **Performance**: 2-3x the engagement of a standard image post

### Optimal Number of Slides

| Slides | When |
|--------|------|
| **4-5** | Simple concepts, short lists, a single insight |
| **6-8** | Sweet spot. Depth + accessibility. The ideal format for most content |
| **9-10** | Complex topics that require detailed development |
| **11+** | Not recommended — engagement drops after the 10th slide |

### Structure of an Effective Carousel

```
SLIDE 1 — COVER (The Hook)
  Bold title that stops the scroll (max 8-10 words)
  Subtitle with a value promise
  Author name + brand logo

SLIDE 2 — THE PROBLEM / CONTEXT
  Relatable situation or surprising data point
  Creates the "open loop" that drives swiping

SLIDE 3 to N-1 — THE CONTENT
  One idea per slide (never more)
  Tagline + Title + Short paragraph (max 40 words)
  Logical flow: each slide builds on the previous one

SLIDE N — CTA (The Close)
  Key takeaway in one sentence
  CTA: comment, save, share, follow me
  Author name + brand logo
```

### Design Rules

1. **One idea per slide** — if you can't summarize it in 6-8 words for the title, it's too complex for a single slide
2. **Max 40 words per slide** — the carousel should feel "light" even on deep topics
3. **Visual consistency** — same fonts, colors, layout across all slides
4. **Readable fonts** — minimum 24pt for body, 36pt+ for titles
5. **White space** — visual breathing room. Better an extra slide than one that's too dense
6. **Arrows/indicators** — visual cues that invite swiping to the next slide
7. **The cover is everything** — only slide 1 appears in the feed. It must work as a standalone

### Technical Specs

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Format** | PDF (document post) |
| **Recommended ratio** | 4:5 (1080x1350px) — takes up more space in the feed |
| **Alternative ratio** | 1:1 (1080x1080px) |
| **Max slides** | 300 (LinkedIn limit) |
| **Tools to create** | aicarousels.com, Canva, Figma, Google Slides |

### Effective Carousel Types

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Numbered list** | "N mistakes/tips/lessons" — one point per slide | "5 screening mistakes that cost you candidates" |
| **Step-by-step how-to** | Guided process with numbered steps | "How to set up a hiring process in 6 steps" |
| **Data + analysis** | Surprising data point → explanation → implications | "72% of CVs get rejected without being read: here's why" |
| **Myth vs reality** | Common belief → why it's wrong → the truth | "3 recruiting myths that are slowing down your company" |
| **Before/After** | Old situation → transformation → result | "Recruiting in 2020 vs 2026" |
| **Framework/Model** | Visual model explained slide by slide | "The STAR framework for evaluating candidates" |

### Carousel Caption

The text that accompanies the carousel:
- **Complementary**, not repetitive (don't rewrite the slides in the text)
- 2-4 sentences that add context
- A question to generate comments
- "Link in comments" if appropriate
- 3-5 hashtags at the end

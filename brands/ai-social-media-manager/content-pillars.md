# Content Pillars — AI Social Media Manager

## The 4 Pillars

### 1. Framework > Prompt (TOFU — Awareness)
**Goal**: Help people understand why a structured system beats single prompts for content creation.

**Topics**:
- The difference between a prompt and a framework
- Why AI output is generic (and how to fix it)
- Knowledge engineering applied to content
- How knowledge systems for AI work

**Best formats**: Reflective LinkedIn posts, X threads, "before/after" carousels

**Example**: "I stopped writing prompts. I started building systems. Here's why."

### 2. 60 Experts in a Repo (MOFU — Consideration)
**Goal**: Show the framework's concrete value — the strategies of top creators, codified and ready to use.

**Topics**:
- Expert profiles and what they teach
- Specific frameworks (Vaynerchuk's Jab/Hook, Miller's StoryBrand, Alic's Hook/Re-hook)
- How the system combines different strategies
- "What would [expert] do with this topic?"

**Best formats**: Carousels (1 expert per slide), "TIL" (Today I Learned) posts, short videos

**Example**: "MrBeast teaches retention. Vaynerchuk teaches distribution. Godin teaches positioning. The framework combines them all."

---

### 3. How It Works (MOFU — How-to)
**Goal**: Practical tutorials on how to use the framework.

**Topics**:
- Quick start: clone -> configure -> generate
- How /create-brand works
- How /linkedin-post works
- How to customize the tone
- How to add a new brand
- Tips and tricks

**Best formats**: How-to carousels, screencast videos, step-by-step threads

**Example**: "Setup in 3 steps: 1. git clone 2. /create-brand 'your-brand' 3. /linkedin-post 'your-topic'. Done."

---

### 4. Behind the Scenes (BRAND — Behind the scenes)
**Goal**: Tell the story of building the framework — why, how, the challenges.

**Topics**:
- Why I built the project
- Architectural decisions (why multi-brand, why .md files)
- What I learned studying 60 experts
- The challenges: what didn't work
- The community and contributions

**Best formats**: LinkedIn storytelling posts, vlog-style videos

**Example**: "I spent weeks reading everything about 60 content creators. Here's the thing that surprised me the most."

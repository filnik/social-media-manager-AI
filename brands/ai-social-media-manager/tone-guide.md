# Tone Guide — AI Social Media Manager

## The Project's Tone

**Tech-practical**: competent + direct + a bit nerdy + zero fluff. The reader learns AND wants to try it.

It's not pure infotainment like a consumer brand. It's the tone of a developer sharing a project they care about: genuine enthusiasm without hype, concrete numbers without vanity metrics, total transparency about limitations.

## The Formula

```
Real problem + Concrete solution + Specific numbers = Content that converts
```

### The 3 Ingredients

**1. The Relatable Problem**
Frustrations the target audience experiences every day with AI and content:
- "I asked ChatGPT to write me a LinkedIn post. It sounded like every other LinkedIn post"
- "3 different prompts, same generic output"
- "I spend more time rewriting AI output than writing from scratch"
- "My 'AI-generated' post got 12 likes. The handwritten one got 200"

**2. The Concrete Solution**
Not theory, not promises — facts:
- "60 experts, 14 templates, 5 skills. Clone and go"
- "The system knows the strategies of Vaynerchuk, Godin, MrBeast — you just type /linkedin-post"
- "Configure your brand once. Generate content forever"

**3. Specific Numbers**
Always real numbers, never vague approximations:
- "60+ experts" (not "dozens of experts")
- "14 templates" (not "lots of templates")
- "5 skills" (not "several features")
- "2 minutes of setup" (not "quick to configure")

## Language Patterns

### Formats That Work

**1. "Before / After"**
The most powerful format for this project:
- "BEFORE: 'ChatGPT, write a LinkedIn post about productivity.' -> Generic output"
- "AFTER: /linkedin-post productivity -> Output with brand tone, strategies from 60 experts, optimized hook"

**2. "The problem with..."**
Setup that identifies the gap:
- "The problem with single prompts: they work once. A framework works every time"
- "The problem with AI content tools: they're expensive, produce generic output, and don't know YOUR brand"

**3. "Framework > Prompt"**
The project's recurring message:
- "A good system beats a good prompt. Every time"
- "I didn't write a prompt. I built a system"
- "A prompt is a message in a bottle. A framework is a ship"

**4. "X experts, Y templates, Z minutes"**
Numbers as hooks:
- "60 experts. 14 templates. 2 minutes of setup. $0"
- "The strategies of MrBeast, Seth Godin, and Vaynerchuk. In a git repo"

## Tone by Platform

### LinkedIn
**Register**: Professional-tech + personal storytelling
- Founder posts: tell HOW and WHY the system was built
- Concrete numbers and results
- The tone is "developer sharing a project", not "marketer selling"
- Open questions for engagement

### GitHub
**Register**: Technical + accessible
- Clear, structured README with quick start
- Practical documentation (not marketing)
- Direct tone: "clone, configure, generate"

### X/Twitter
**Register**: Concise + nerdy
- Technical threads on knowledge engineering
- One-liners on the "framework > prompt" concept
- Output screenshots as proof

# Brand Voice — AI Social Media Manager

## Who It Is

### Project Identity
**AI Social Media Manager** is an open-source framework for generating social content with Claude Code. It's not a SaaS, not an app, not a subscription tool. It's a knowledge system — 60+ expert profiles, 14 templates, 5 automated skills — that turns Claude Code into a competent social media manager who knows the strategies of the world's best content creators.

### Tagline
**"Framework > Prompt"**

### Author
- **Filippo** — Developer and creator of the framework
- Open-source, contributions welcome

### Key Differentiator
While everyone is looking for "the perfect prompt" to generate content, this project proves that a **structured system** (framework, experts, brand voice, templates) beats any single prompt. It's not a prompt. It's an entire content department, codified.

**In one sentence**: "The social media manager you don't hire, don't pay, and that knows the strategies of 60 world-class experts."

## The StoryBrand Framework Applied

*(the hero is the creator/marketer, the guide is the framework)*

### The Hero: the creator / marketer / solopreneur
- The framework is not the hero. The person who needs to create content every day is
- The hero wants quality content without spending hours writing it
- The hero knows single prompts produce generic content. They want something better

### The Villain: generic AI-generated content
- The villain is not AI — it's the superficial use of AI
- Vague prompts = vague output
- "Write a LinkedIn post" produces the same result for everyone
- The villain steals time (endless rewrites) and credibility (content that "sounds like ChatGPT")

### The Hero's 3 Problems

| Level | Problem | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **External** (tangible) | Creating content takes too much time | "I spend 2 hours on a LinkedIn post that doesn't perform" |
| **Internal** (emotional) | Frustration with generic output | "Every AI output sounds the same. It doesn't sound like ME" |
| **Philosophical** (principle) | AI should enhance creativity, not flatten it | "A good system should produce unique content, not copy-paste templates" |

### The Guide: the framework
- **Empathy**: "We know what it's like to rewrite an AI post 5 times because it 'doesn't sound right'"
- **Authority**: 60+ experts studied, 14 tested templates, multi-brand system

### The Plan (3 Steps)
1. **Clone the repo** — setup in 2 minutes
2. **Configure your brand** — /create-brand walks you through it step by step
3. **Generate content** — /linkedin-post or /video-script, personalized to YOUR voice

## Tone of Voice

### Tone Formula
**Tech-savvy + Practical + A bit nerdy + Zero hype**

| Ingredient | Meaning | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Tech-savvy** | Speaks the language of developers and power users | "A knowledge engineering system applied to content" |
| **Practical** | Shows concrete results, not theory | "60 experts, 14 templates, 5 skills. Clone and go" |
| **A bit nerdy** | Genuine enthusiasm for the system, not for marketing | "I spent weeks codifying how MrBeast thinks" |
| **Zero hype** | No buzzwords, no exaggerated promises | "It's not magic. It's a good system" |

### Language
- **Modern English with a direct tone**
- Natural tech terminology: framework, open-source, skill, prompt, clone, repo
- Short, direct sentences
- Acknowledges limitations: "it doesn't replace a human social media manager — it empowers them"

## Communication Rules

### DO's
1. **Show the system, don't sell the system** — It's open-source, there's nothing to sell
2. **Specific numbers** — "60 experts, 14 templates" > "tons of resources"
3. **Framework > Prompt** — The recurring message: systems beat single prompts
4. **Acknowledge limitations** — AI doesn't replace human creativity. It amplifies it
5. **Credit the experts** — The value comes from the strategies of 60+ experts, not from the code

### DON'Ts
1. **Never hype** — No "revolutionary", "game-changer", "the future of marketing"
2. **Never sell** — It's open-source. The tone is "sharing something useful", not "buy this"
3. **Never disparage paid tools** — We're not against SaaS. We're a different alternative
4. **Never promise virality** — "Better content" yes. "Guaranteed viral posts" no
5. **Never use unnecessary jargon** — Even though it's a tech project, the content must be accessible

## Positioning

### What It's NOT
- Not a SaaS (no subscription)
- Not a single prompt (it's a complete system)
- Not a replacement for a social media manager
- Not limited to one brand (it's multi-brand)

### What It IS
- A knowledge engineering framework for content
- A system that codifies the strategies of the world's best creators
- An open-source project anyone can use and contribute to
- Proof that structure > improvisation in content creation

### One-liner for Each Context

| Context | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **GitHub README** | "Open-source framework for generating social content with Claude Code. 60+ experts, 14 templates, 5 automated skills" |
| **LinkedIn** | "I built a social media manager that's not a SaaS. It's an open-source framework inside Claude Code" |
| **Elevator pitch** | "The strategies of 60 world-class content experts, codified into a framework anyone can use for free" |

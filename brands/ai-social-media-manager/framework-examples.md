# Framework Examples — AI Social Media Manager

## Example 1 — LinkedIn Post L6 (Founder Post)

**Pillar**: Behind the Scenes
**Target persona**: Marco (Founder), Sara (Marketer)
**Brand level**: Direct (the post talks about the project)

I spent weeks building a social media manager that's not a SaaS.

It's an open-source framework that runs inside Claude Code.

The idea: instead of paying for tools that generate generic content,
why not build a system that knows HOW the best content creators think?

What's inside:
-> 60+ expert profiles (from MrBeast to Seth Godin, from Montemagno to Vaynerchuk)
-> 14 ready-made templates for LinkedIn and video
-> 5 automated skills (/linkedin-post, /video-script, /content-ideas, /create-brand, /carousel)
-> Multi-brand system: configure your brand once, generate content forever

How it works:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run /create-brand "your-brand"
3. Answer a few questions about tone, personas, pillars
4. Generate LinkedIn posts or video scripts that sound like you, not like ChatGPT

Everything is open-source on GitHub.

I'm sharing this because I believe that frameworks > single prompts.
A good system beats a good prompt, every time.

**Analysis**: Hook with a fact ("weeks"), clear differentiator ("not a SaaS"), specific numbers (60+, 14, 5), soft CTA (link in comments), zero hype.

## Example 2 — LinkedIn Post L3 (Educational Post)

**Pillar**: Framework > Prompt
**Target persona**: Sara (Marketer), Alex (Developer)
**Brand level**: Implicit (the project is not mentioned directly)

90% of people use AI for content the wrong way.

They type: "Create a LinkedIn post about productivity."

The AI responds with something generic, full of buzzwords, that sounds like every other post.

The problem isn't AI. It's the input.

A prompt is a message in a bottle.
A framework is a ship.

The difference:
-> A prompt doesn't know who you are
-> A prompt doesn't know your tone
-> A prompt doesn't know your target audience
-> A prompt hasn't studied what works on LinkedIn

A framework has all of that. Configured once, it works forever.

You don't need to write better prompts.
You need to build better systems.

Agree, or do you think the right prompt is enough?

**Analysis**: Provocative hook ("the wrong way"), prompt vs framework contrast, zero mention of the project (readers look in the comments), CTA with a polarizing question.

## Example 3 — V-style Carousel (Educational)

**Pillar**: 60 Experts
**Target persona**: Sara (Marketer)
**Format**: 8-slide carousel

**Slide 1 (Cover)**:
"5 strategies from the world's best content creators
(that you can apply today)"

**Slide 2**:
🎯 Gary Vaynerchuk — "Document, Don't Create"
Don't make up stories. Document your real journey.
More scalable, more authentic, more sustainable.

**Slide 3**:
📖 Donald Miller — "The hero is the customer"
Your brand is not the protagonist.
Your customer is. You're the guide.

**Slide 4**:
⚡ Brendan Kane — "3 seconds"
If you don't capture attention in the first 3 seconds, you've lost.
Every piece of content starts with an irresistible hook.

**Slide 5**:
🔄 Justin Welsh — "Content is compounding interest"
The first 6 months feel pointless.
The next 6 change everything. Consistency > virality.

**Slide 6**:
🎣 Jasmin Alic — "Hook + Re-hook"
The first line captures. The second closes the door.
LinkedIn only shows 3 lines. Use them well.

**Slide 7**:
📊 Bonus: Richard van der Blom's data
Carousels generate 2-3x the reach of text posts.
(Like this one you're reading right now.)

**Slide 8 (CTA)**:
These are 5 out of 60+ strategies.
All codified in an open-source framework.

# Audience Personas — AI Social Media Manager

## Overview

The framework targets 3 main personas. They all share one problem: creating quality social content takes too much time and results with generic AI are mediocre. But their motivations and contexts differ.

**Golden rule**: If the content doesn't resonate with at least one of these personas, don't publish it.

---

## Persona 1: Alex — Developer / AI Enthusiast

### Profile
- **Age**: 25-40
- **Role**: Developer, AI engineer, tech lead, indie hacker
- **Context**: Already uses Claude Code or AI tools for daily work
- **Platforms**: GitHub, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Hacker News
- **Motivation**: Curious to see how knowledge can be structured for AI

### Frustrations
1. **"Single prompts don't scale"** — Has tried writing prompts for social content, but has to start from scratch every time
2. **"The output is always generic"** — ChatGPT/Claude without context produce interchangeable content
3. **"I don't have time for marketing"** — Knows they should build a personal brand but code comes first
4. **"Marketing tools cost too much"** — Buffer, Hootsuite, Jasper... subscription after subscription

### Language
- "Interesting architecture"
- "How many tokens does it consume?"
- "Can I contribute?"
- "How does it handle context?"
- "Fork and customization?"

### What Attracts Them
- The project structure (clean architecture, organized files)
- The fact that it's open-source
- The idea of "knowledge engineering" applied to content
- The ability to customize and extend
- Specific numbers (60 experts, 14 templates — not "lots of resources")

### How to Reach Them
- **GitHub**: Clear README, well-documented structure
- **LinkedIn**: Tech posts with a "how I built the system" angle
- **X/Twitter**: Technical threads on knowledge engineering
- **Hacker News**: If the project is interesting enough, they'll find it on their own

## Persona 2: Sara — Content Creator / Marketer

### Profile
- **Age**: 28-45
- **Role**: Content marketer, social media manager, freelance writer, marketing manager
- **Context**: Creates content every day, already uses AI as an assistant
- **Platforms**: LinkedIn (primary), Instagram, TikTok
- **Motivation**: Wants better content in less time

### Frustrations
1. **"AI writes like a robot"** — Generated content all sounds the same, with no personality
2. **"I spend more time editing than writing"** — AI generates a draft, but rewriting it takes longer than writing from scratch
3. **"I don't know every strategy out there"** — Knows that MrBeast, Vaynerchuk, Godin have specific frameworks, but doesn't have time to study them all
4. **"Every brand has a different tone"** — Manages multiple clients/brands and switching between them is exhausting

### Language
- "But does it sound natural?"
- "Can I customize the tone?"
- "Does it work for my industry?"
- "How long does it take to set up?"
- "Do I need to know how to code?"

### What Attracts Them
- Output quality (content that sounds "human")
- 60+ experts as a knowledge base (no need to study them all)
- The multi-brand system (one setup, many clients)
- Ready-made templates (L1-L8, V1-V6)
- The fact that tone is configured once and the system maintains it

### How to Reach Them
- **LinkedIn**: Before/after posts (generic prompt vs framework)
- **Instagram**: Carousel with practical tips from the framework
- **Newsletter**: Deep dives on how the system uses expert strategies

## Persona 3: Marco — Founder / Solopreneur

### Profile
- **Age**: 30-50
- **Role**: Founder, CEO, solopreneur, indie maker
- **Context**: Has a product/service and needs to create content to promote it
- **Platforms**: LinkedIn (primary), X/Twitter
- **Motivation**: Wants personal branding and lead generation without hiring a social media manager

### Frustrations
1. **"I'm not a content creator"** — Their job is the product, not marketing
2. **"Hiring a SMM costs too much"** — A freelancer costs $1,000-3,000/month. An agency, double that
3. **"AI content doesn't represent me"** — Every generated post "sounds like ChatGPT", not like them
4. **"I don't know where to start"** — Knows LinkedIn works for B2B but doesn't have a strategy

### Language
- "How much time do I need?"
- "Does it work for my use case?"
- "I don't have technical skills"
- "ROI?"
- "Can I see an example?"

### What Attracts Them
- The cost savings (free vs thousands of dollars/month for a SMM)
- The guided setup (/create-brand asks the right questions)
- The fact that once configured, the system "knows" their brand
- Concrete output examples
- The credibility of a system based on 60+ real experts

### How to Reach Them
- **LinkedIn**: Storytelling posts ("I built my own social media manager")
- **X/Twitter**: Threads on "how I do content marketing at zero cost"
- **Community**: Indie maker, startup, solopreneur communities

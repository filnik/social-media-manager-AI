# Jenny Hoyos — YouTube Expert Profile

## Profile
- **Who she is**: An American creator of Colombian origin, graduated from Florida International University, considered the "queen of YouTube Shorts". At just 20 years old she built one of the most successful Shorts channels in the world, reaching 1.5 million subscribers with only 97 Shorts. Her videos regularly accumulate 10+ million views each. She started with a specific niche (finance for teenagers), reaching 100K subscribers, then made a strategic pivot toward broader content (saving and money hacks) that brought her to 3M+ subscribers. YouTube itself chose her as an official case study for Shorts.

## Core Philosophy
1. **You have 1 second to capture attention**: in short formats there's no "warm-up phase". The hook must be immediate, visual, and understandable even without audio.
2. **90% retention is the minimum**: a good Short must retain 90%+ of viewers until the end. Below this threshold, the algorithm won't push the content.
3. **Storytelling > Information**: people don't share information, they share stories. Even a 30-second video needs a complete narrative arc.
4. **The ending determines everything**: viewers judge the video based on the emotion they feel at the end. A weak ending ruins all the work done before.
5. **Less is more**: better 1 perfect Short per month than 30 mediocre ones. Script quality is more important than publishing frequency.

## Frameworks and Methodologies

### BUTS (But-So) Storytelling Method
A storytelling method for maintaining narrative tension in short videos:
- Every Short follows a structure of chained conflicts using "but" and "so"
- Example: "I bought a $1 sandwich... BUT it tasted like nothing... SO I added the secret ingredients... BUT the total cost went up to $3... SO I compared it with the original $8 one..."
- Every "but" introduces a new conflict, every "so" a reaction — the viewer can't stop watching because the story never stops

### Foreshadowing Hook
An opening technique that builds expectation:
- The first second hints at the final result/comparison without revealing it
- Example: "Chick-fil-A has the best chicken sandwich, but I'm not paying $6. So I make it for $1 and then compare them."
- The viewer MUST watch to the end to see the comparison result

### Content Buckets Strategy
A system for organizing content into recognizable thematic series:
- Each "bucket" is a recurring series (e.g., "$1 fast food items", "finding gold in cheap items")
- When a viewer enjoys a video from a series, they watch all the others in the same series
- Buckets create expectation and recognition: the viewer knows what to expect and comes back for it

### Power Words System
Words that generate instant clicks and views:
- **Curiosity**: "secret", "hidden", "nobody knows"
- **Urgency**: "banned", "last time", "before it disappears"
- **Value**: "free", "$1", "half price"
- **Exclusivity**: "for the first time", "never seen", "sneak peek"
- These words must appear in the first 3 seconds, in the title, or in the text overlay

### Pivot Strategy (Niche > Mainstream)
A 2-phase growth strategy:
1. **Phase 1 — Niche**: start with a specific and less competitive topic to build a base of loyal subscribers (e.g., finance for teenagers)
2. **Phase 2 — Expansion**: once you've reached critical mass, broaden the topic while keeping the style and format (e.g., from "teen finance" to "saving for everyone")

## Hook and Retention Techniques
- **Silent visual hook**: the first frame must communicate the content even without audio. Clear text overlay, impactful images, immediate action
- **1 second rule**: if the viewer can't understand the video's topic within 1 second, they'll swipe. No intro, no greetings, no context — immediate action
- **Transitions as narrative engine**: transitions aren't decorative, they're narrative. Every transition moves the story forward and maintains the pace
- **Continuous conflict**: never leave a moment of "calm" in the video. Every 3-5 seconds something new must happen
- **High emotional intensity ending**: the video must end at the moment of maximum emotion. Never close with an "and so..." but with a climax
- **Retention rate as north-star metric**: Jenny obsessively analyzes the retention curve of every video, identifying drop-off points and modifying the structure of subsequent videos accordingly

## Memorable Quotes and Concepts
- **"You have one second to hook someone on Shorts. One. Second."** — On the urgency of the hook
- **"A good hook should be so clear that viewers understand the video even on mute."** — On the accessibility of the visual hook
- **"I aim for 90% retention or higher. Below that, the algorithm won't push your content."** — On the retention threshold
- **"Use 'but' and 'so' to keep the story moving. Never let the viewer feel like the story is over."** — On the BUTS method
- **"The viewer decides how they felt about the video based on the intensity of the emotion at the end."** — On the importance of the ending

## How to Apply to Your Brand
- **Use the BUTS method for every Short**: even a 30-second B2B video can follow the "but/so" structure. Example: "[Common industry problem]... BUT most solutions cost too much... SO we tried a different approach... BUT the results surprised us..."
- **Create recognizable Content Buckets**: define 3-4 recurring series for [your brand]'s Shorts channel. Example: "Industry myths in 30 seconds", "Tool of the week", "Before and after". Each series becomes a recurring appointment for the audience.
- **Apply the first-second rule**: watch your Short without audio. If you can't understand the topic in 1 second, redo it. Add clear text overlay and an impactful image in the first frame.
- **Aim for 90% retention**: if your Shorts have retention below 70%, the problem is in the script, not in the production. Use the BUTS method to add narrative tension.
- **Start from the niche, then expand**: don't try to speak to everyone. A SaaS brand could start with Shorts on a single use case, build a base, and then expand to broader industry topics.

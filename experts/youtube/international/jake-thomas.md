# Jake Thomas (Creator Hooks) — YouTube Expert Profile

## Profile
- **Who he is**: A writer and YouTube title analyst, founder of Creator Hooks, the go-to newsletter for optimizing YouTube video titles and packaging. Every week he analyzes 5 different industries (from a list of 30+) searching for "outlier videos" — videos with far more views than normal for that channel. He then breaks down the titles of those videos to understand why they worked. He has analyzed over 700+ successful titles, creating a database of replicable patterns. He offers Creator Hooks Pro ($19/month), a searchable database of all analyzed titles. He's not a traditional "YouTube guru": his approach is based on human psychology and data analysis, not personal opinion.
- **YouTube subscribers**: N/A (his impact is primarily via newsletter and tools)
- **Total views**: N/A
- **Specialization**: YouTube titles, thumbnails, CTR optimization, content packaging, click psychology
- **Channel**: Creator Hooks (newsletter + tool, not a traditional YouTube channel)

## Core Philosophy
1. **Packaging is 50% of a video's success**: the most brilliant content in the world will never be seen if the title and thumbnail don't generate the click. Packaging isn't an accessory, it's half the work.
2. **Human psychology doesn't change, algorithms do**: studying why people click (curiosity, fear, desire) is more durable than chasing the latest algorithm change.
3. **Model the winners, don't reinvent**: you don't need to reinvent the wheel. Study titles that have already worked, understand the pattern, and adapt it to your context.
4. **Title, thumbnail, and hook never work alone**: the 3 elements form a "Tension Triangle" where each must reinforce the others without repeating the same information.
5. **One idea per title, no more**: the best titles communicate ONE single concept. Clarity beats completeness.

## Frameworks and Methodologies

### The 3 Click-Worthy Emotions
Every successful title activates at least one of these 3 emotions:
1. **Curiosity**: the most powerful. Creates a question in the viewer's mind that can only be resolved by watching the video
2. **Fear**: activates the protective instinct. "The mistakes you're making", "Why you're losing..."
3. **Desire**: promises a result the viewer wants to achieve. "How I did X", "The method for..."

The winning formula: **Curiosity + Fear** or **Curiosity + Desire**

### Open Loop Technique
A technique for creating irresistible curiosity:
- Start a story or piece of information in the title but DON'T complete it
- The viewer must watch the video to "close the loop"
- Example: "I tried [thing] for 30 days. I didn't expect this." — the "this" is the open loop
- Open loops activate the Zeigarnik effect: the brain is wired to want to complete incomplete information

### Outlier Analysis Method
A systematic process for finding winning titles:
1. **Select 5 industries** from the 30+ list every week
2. **Search for outlier videos**: videos with 5-10x more views than the channel's average
3. **Isolate the title**: analyze what makes that title different from others
4. **Identify the pattern**: what emotion does it activate? What structure does it use? What power words does it contain?
5. **Create variants**: adapt the pattern to your industry and audience

### Tension Triangle (Title + Thumbnail + Hook)
The 3 packaging elements must work in synergy:
- **Title**: creates the initial tension (the promise or the question)
- **Thumbnail**: visually amplifies the tension (doesn't repeat the title, it completes it)
- **Hook (first 5 seconds)**: confirms the promise and adds a new level of tension
- Key rule: if you remove one of the 3 elements, the other 2 must still work on their own

### Title Formulas (Replicable Patterns)
Title structures that work across industries:
- **"[Number] [Things] that [Result]"**: "7 mistakes that are destroying your [topic]"
- **"How [Specific Result] (in [Time])"**: "How I doubled my views in 30 days"
- **"[Controversial Statement]"**: "YouTube SEO is dead"
- **"[Famous Person/Brand] [Unexpected Action]"**: "Google just changed everything"
- **"I tried [Thing] for [Time]. Here's what happened."**: the "experiment" format
- **"The truth about [Controversial Topic]"**: activates curiosity and fear simultaneously

### A/B Testing System
A methodology for testing titles and thumbnails:
- Use thumbnailtest.com and TubeBuddy for A/B testing
- Change the title OR thumbnail every 24 hours (never both at once)
- The first day always has the highest CTR — don't test during that window
- Compare normalized CTR at 48-72 hours for reliable results

### Target Keyword Placement
A rule for title optimization:
- Place the target keyword in the **first 5 words** of the title
- After the keyword, add engagement elements (numbers, power words, emotions)
- Use separators (colons, dashes) to create 2-part titles: "Keyword: Emotional Element"

## Hook and Retention Techniques
- **The title is the first hook**: if the title doesn't generate curiosity, no hook in the first seconds will save the video
- **Confirm + Expand**: the first 5 seconds must confirm the title's promise and then add ONE MORE reason to stay
- **Don't repeat the title**: if the title says "5 mistakes", don't start the video saying "Today I'll show you 5 mistakes". Start with a story, a shocking data point, or a question
- **Power words in the first frame**: use the same power words that work in titles in the first spoken seconds of the video

## Memorable Quotes and Concepts
- **"There are three click-worthy emotions: curiosity, fear, and desire. The best titles combine curiosity with one of the other two."** — On click psychology
- **"Open a loop. Start a story but don't finish it. The brain is wired to want completion."** — On the Open Loop technique
- **"Title, thumbnail, and hook form a Tension Triangle. They must never work in isolation."** — On the Tension Triangle
- **"I look for outlier videos — videos with way more views than other videos on the same channel. That's where the magic is."** — On the Outlier Analysis
- **"Place your target keyword in the first 5 words. Then add the emotional element."** — On keyword placement

## How to Apply to Your Brand
- **Use the 3 emotions as a filter**: before publishing any video, ask yourself which emotion the title activates. If the answer is "none" or "information", rewrite it. Example: "Guide to project management" (zero emotion) vs. "The system that saved my team from chaos" (curiosity + desire).
- **Build a database of outliers in your industry**: every week, find the 3 most-viewed videos in your industry and analyze the titles. After a month you'll have 12 replicable patterns for [your brand].
- **Apply the Tension Triangle**: when creating a video, design the title, thumbnail, and hook BEFORE the script. If the 3 elements don't create synergistic tension, the video won't work. Example: Title "The tool nobody uses" + Thumbnail with a surprised expression + Hook "I discovered a tool that 95% of professionals ignore".
- **Test at least 3 titles for important videos**: don't publish the first title that comes to mind. Write 5 variants, choose 3, and use A/B testing to find the winner. Tools like TubeBuddy make the process simple.
- **Use the Title Formulas as a starting point**: don't copy, adapt. Take a formula that worked in another industry and rewrite it for yours. Example: "7 marketing mistakes" becomes "7 [your field] mistakes that cost you clients every month".

# David Perell

## Profile

### Who He Is
David Perell is an American writer, educator, and digital entrepreneur, considered one of the most authoritative voices in the world on **online writing** and **audience building**. He graduated in Media Studies from Elon University in 2016. After graduation he moved to New York to work as a sales associate at an advertising agency. He was fired after just 7 months because his interest in "big-picture ideas" clashed with the demands of the role. He then decided to dedicate himself full-time to online writing, with his parents paying his rent for a year while he built his digital presence. From that calculated risk, an educational empire was born.

### Write of Passage
Founded in January 2019, **Write of Passage** was the benchmark online course for digital writing. It trained over 1,000 students from 40+ countries, with participants from companies like Intel, Google, and Twitter. Price: $3,995 (Essential) / $6,995 (Lifetime Access). Estimated revenue: $1.5-2M+ per cohort cycle, with $2M+ in annual revenue overall. **Important update:** Write of Passage closed at the end of 2024. The last cohort ran from October 7 to November 13, 2024. Perell explained that AI and the changing internet era made a pivot necessary.

### Podcasts
- **How I Write** (since 2023): podcast dedicated to the "behind the scenes" of the writing process of top authors. Guests: Daniel Pink, Tim Ferriss, Sam Altman. Weekly on Apple, Spotify, and YouTube.
- **North Star Podcast** (since 2017): nearly 200 interviews with high-performers like Seth Godin, Ryan Holiday, Tyler Cowen, Jason Fried, Erika Nardini.

## Core Philosophy

### The 5 Fundamental Principles

**1. Writing as Networking ("Writing is the best networking")**
Writing online is not just communication: it's a **Serendipity Vehicle**, a vehicle that attracts people, opportunities, and collaborations into your life. Instead of traditional networking (events, business cards), you publish ideas and become a beacon for like-minded people. Relationships today start online and then solidify offline.

**2. Personal Monopoly ("Be the only one, not the best")**
Don't compete to be the best in a crowded field. Find the unique intersection of your interests, skills, and personality where you can be **the only one**. The internet rewards differentiation with power law results: those who position themselves uniquely capture a disproportionate share of attention.

**3. Audience-First Products ("Audience first, product second")**
An inverted model compared to traditional business: first build an authentic audience by sharing valuable ideas, then create products that solve that audience's problems. This reduces risk because you've already validated demand. Write of Passage was born this way: 10,000 email subscribers, zero marketing spend, immediate product-market fit.

**4. Internet as Leverage ("The cheapest leverage")**
> "The cheapest leverage most people have access to is their ability to write."

The internet has democratized distribution. Anyone with a computer and an internet connection can reach millions of people. Online writing is the most accessible and powerful lever for building reputation, opportunities, and business.

**5. Writing is Thinking ("To write is to think")**
> "Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. Try to sound smart and your writing won't be clear. Try to write clearly and you will sound smart."

Writing is not a final output: it's the thinking process itself. Writing forces you to clarify ideas, find flaws in reasoning, and organize mental chaos into structure.

### How He Stands Out from Others
Unlike content marketing gurus (Gary Vee, Neil Patel) or persuasive copywriters, Perell positions himself at the intersection of **deep thinking** and **digital distribution**. He doesn't teach writing to sell, but writing to think better, and using that thinking to build a unique professional identity. His approach is closer to a philosopher of digital communication than a marketer.

## Frameworks and Methodologies

### 1. Personal Monopoly Framework

**What it is:** The unique intersection of your skills, interests, and personality where you can be recognized as the go-to thinker on a topic.

**How to find it (3 questions):**
1. **What compliments do you receive most often?** (signal of natural strength)
2. **What projects excite you enough to work on them for free?** (signal of authentic passion)
3. **What ideas have fascinated you for years without getting tired of them?** (signal of sustainability)

**Rules:**
- The skills in your monopoly must be **unusual, complementary, experiential, and specific**
- The less your combination of skills exists in other people, the less competition you'll have
- It takes about **5 years** to crystallize your Personal Monopoly
- Choose a small but growing market and become an expert before others
- Write about every aspect of your monopoly: people, concepts, history

**Practical application for [your brand]:**
The Personal Monopoly for [your brand] could be: **"The intersection of AI reasoning, SMBs, and the ironic demystification of traditional recruiting."** No other HR-tech player combines: (1) AI with real reasoning (not keyword matching), (2) exclusive focus on SMBs, (3) infotainment communication with irony and value. This should be written everywhere, repeatedly, from different angles.

---

### 2. POP Writing Framework

Every piece of content is evaluated on three dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Means | Risk If Missing | Risk If Too Much |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P - Personal** | Lived stories and experiences. Creates emotional connection. | Cold and detached content | "Intellectual junk food" - entertainment without substance |
| **O - Observational** | Hidden patterns others don't see. Generates "Aha!" moments. | Nothing new or surprising | Dry and academic content |
| **P - Playful** | Analogies, thought experiments, pop references, wordplay. | Boring and forgettable content | Not credible, too lightweight |

**Balance is key.** Content that feels stale is almost always lacking in one of these three dimensions.

**Application for [your brand]:**
- **Personal:** Real stories of frustrated recruiters, ghosted candidates, founders who can't sleep because they can't find people
- **Observational:** "73% of CVs get rejected by ATS for missing keywords - but the best candidate often doesn't use the right keywords." Patterns your target recognizes but can't articulate
- **Playful:** Recruiting memes, absurd analogies ("Searching for talent with keyword matching is like searching for your soulmate by filtering only for height"), ironic tone

---

### 3. Content Triangle (Conversational Development)

Ideas develop through three phases of conversation:

```
Phase 1: FRIENDS
(Discover surprising ideas)
         |
         v
Phase 2: READERS
(Test if they resonate)
         |
         v
Phase 3: EDITORS
(Improve the communication)
```

**How it works:**
1. **With friends:** You talk about an idea and observe reactions. If it surprises them, it's good. If it bores them, discard it.
2. **With readers:** You publish the idea (post, thread) and measure feedback. Does the idea have "Idea-Market Fit"?
3. **With editors:** You work on the form. How to say the same thing in the clearest, most powerful way.

**The distillation principle:** Ideas pass through the Content Triangle like sap becomes maple syrup: the raw material is distilled until it becomes sweet and concentrated.

**Famous example:** James Clear wrote weekly articles on habits for 5 years, using feedback to refine ideas, until he compiled them into "Atomic Habits."

**Application for [your brand]:**
Before writing a long article on "Why SMBs can't find talent," test the thesis as a short LinkedIn post. If it generates comments and shares, it's ready to become an in-depth article. If it generates silence, reformulate the angle.

---

### 4. Writing as Networking

**Principle:** "By making it easy for people to find you online, you'll create a vehicle for serendipity."

**How it works in practice:**
- You consistently publish your ideas
- The right people find you (clients, partners, investors, talent)
- Connections form that you never would have made through traditional networking
- Every piece of content is a "perpetual business card" that works for you 24/7

**The formula:**
> Write your best ideas --> Like-minded people find you --> Unexpected opportunities materialize --> Opportunities generate new ideas --> Repeat

**Application for [your brand]:**
The founders of [your brand] should write regularly on LinkedIn about: (1) the real problems of recruiting in SMBs, (2) how AI is changing the rules of the game, (3) real success stories and failures. This writing attracts exactly the target: HR managers and SMB entrepreneurs who recognize themselves in those problems.

---

### 5. Capture Habit and Note-Taking

**Principle:** "By capturing ideas in the moment, you can effectively start essays when they're 80% finished."

**The system:**
- Capture constantly: the best ideas you consume, the epiphanies you have, the things you already write to colleagues and friends
- Don't try to make the system too neat: order helps you find things, but **reduces creative serendipity**
- "Modern writing isn't created - it's assembled": modern writing is an assembly of notes captured over time
- The purpose of notes is **to write**, not to have the perfect note-taking system

**Criteria for capturing an idea (PIES):**
- **P**ersonal: it relates to you directly
- **I**nspiring: it stimulates you
- **E**asily lost: you'd lose it if you don't capture it now
- **E**ffective: it's useful for your writing

**Application for [your brand]:**
Every conversation with clients, every objection in a sales call, every candidate feedback is material for content. Create a Slack/Notion channel where the whole team can drop "content nuggets" in real time.

---

### 6. CRIBS Framework for Editing

CRIBS turns anyone into an editor because it focuses on the **reader's emotions** instead of writing mechanics.

| Letter | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **C** | Confusing | Rewrite more clearly |
| **R** | Repeated | Remove the repetition |
| **I** | Interesting/Insightful | Expand and go deeper |
| **B** | Boring | Delete without mercy |
| **S** | Surprising | Build tension toward that moment |

**Golden rule:** When something is confusing, repeated, or boring, pull away. When something is interesting or surprising, dig deeper.

**Application for [your brand]:**
Use CRIBS as an internal checklist before publishing any content. Have someone outside the team read the draft and ask: "Where did you get confused? Where did you get bored? What surprised you?"

---

### 7. Shiny Dime Concept

**What it is:** The smallest viable idea you can write about. Like a shiny dime that becomes the center of everything.

**The test:** Can you summarize the idea in a single sentence? If not, it's not small enough.

**The common mistake:** Writers want to explain their entire worldview in a single article. The result is a sprawling piece that goes nowhere.

**The metaphor:** As a child, Perell built airports with toy models. Instead of drawing a control tower, he placed a shiny dime on the floor and "the entire airport came to life." The same is true for writing: find your shiny dime and everything else organizes around it.

**Application for [your brand]:**
Don't write "Everything About AI Recruiting." Write: "Why the best candidate for your SMB probably doesn't use the word 'proactive' in their CV." One precise, visualizable idea that captures attention.

---

### 8. Audience Building Flywheel

Perell's flywheel model shows how each activity feeds the next:

```
Twitter/LinkedIn (discovery)
    --> Newsletter (trust)
        --> Course/Product (monetization)
            --> Successful students (social proof)
                --> Word of mouth (new discovery)
                    --> Back to step 1
```

**Specific tactics:**
- **Public platforms --> private platforms:** Find people on Twitter/LinkedIn, bring them to email. Email is the channel you own.
- **Free mini-courses > lead magnets:** Perell had much more success with email mini-courses (e.g., "7-day writing course") compared to classic downloadable PDFs.
- **95% of content should be pure value.** Only 5% can be promotional.
- **Every successful student becomes an organic promoter.** When they go on podcasts or write, they mention where they started.

**Application for [your brand]:**
1. LinkedIn as the discovery platform (daily founder posts)
2. Newsletter/free mini-course on "How to Hire Your First Employee with AI" as a bridge to email
3. Community/group as a trust-building space
4. The product (the platform) as a natural conversion
5. Every SMB that hires well with [your brand] becomes a case study that feeds step 1

## How to Apply to Your Brand

### 1. Building the Personal Monopoly for [your brand]

**The formula:** AI reasoning (not keywords) + SMBs + infotainment communication = no direct competitors.

**Concrete actions:**
- Define in one sentence: "[your brand] is the only recruiting platform that reasons like a headhunter but costs like software, built for SMBs"
- Write about every aspect of this monopoly: AI, SMBs, broken recruiting, human stories
- Don't try to please everyone. Polarize: "Keyword matching is dead. Here's why."
- Give yourself 12-18 months to crystallize the positioning in the market's mind

### 2. Using the POP Framework to Balance Infotainment and Value

**Personal:** The founders tell real stories -- how they discovered that keyword recruiting doesn't work, the failures before [your brand], conversations with frustrated HR managers.

**Observational:** Data and patterns your target lives but can't explain:
- "50% of SMBs have never used an ATS"
- "The companies that hire fastest aren't the ones with the most applicants, but the ones with the clearest processes"

**Playful:** The infotainment that sets you apart:
- "The perfect CV doesn't exist. But the perfect candidate for your company does -- your ATS just rejected them because they didn't write 'team player'"
- Memes, pop culture analogies, conversational tone

### 3. Founder Writing as an Audience Engine

Perell demonstrates that the founder who writes regularly becomes the face of the brand. For [your brand]:
- At least 3-4 LinkedIn posts per week from the founders
- 1 long-form article per month on a deep topic (newsletter/blog)
- Every post follows the formula: **Surprising hook --> Useful insight --> Soft CTA**
- Founders must reply to EVERY comment in the first 60 minutes (the algorithm rewards early engagement)

### 4. Audience Building for a Nascent Community

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Seeding**
- Publish pure-value content without asking for anything in return
- Identify the 50 most relevant LinkedIn profiles (SMB HR managers, labor consultants, founders) and engage with their content
- Launch a free email mini-course: "5 Days to Revolutionize Recruiting at Your SMB"

**Phase 2 (Months 3-6): Cultivation**
- Launch the weekly newsletter with exclusive insights
- Create a community (Slack, LinkedIn group) for SMB HR managers
- Start collecting success stories (even small ones)

**Phase 3 (Months 6-12): Harvesting**
- Case studies become your flywheel: every satisfied SMB = content + referral
- Founders get invited as guests on HR podcasts
- The community becomes self-sustaining with discussions and shares

## Hook and Virality Techniques

### How Perell Captures Attention

**The "3 Yeses in 30 Seconds" rule:**
The reader must nod (say "yes") to:
1. The title
2. The subtitle
3. The first sentence

If they get to the third sentence, they're hooked.

### Recurring Patterns in His Content

**1. Counterintuitive opening:**
Start with a statement that challenges conventional wisdom.
- Example: "The best writers don't write more. They delete more."

**2. Surprise as a base ingredient:**
> "I rely on an ingredient known as surprise. I wrap surprise into each sentence of my essays."

Every sentence should contain an unexpected element. If the reader can predict what you're about to say, you've lost.

**3. The Archipelago of Ideas:**
Treat ideas like islands and build bridges between them. It's not a linear list but a map of unexpected connections.

**4. The Mega-Brainstorm before writing:**
Gather ideas, facts, and stories in a single document. Collect, collect, then select. Keep adding until it becomes **painful not to write** the article.

**5. The 80/50 principle:**
- 80% of the article's ideas will emerge AFTER you start writing
- 50% of the ideas you start with will turn out to be wrong
- Consequence: don't over-plan. Start and let the writing guide the thinking.

### Structure of Most Successful Content

```
1. HOOK: Surprising or counterintuitive statement (1-2 sentences)
2. TENSION: Why what you believe is wrong (2-3 paragraphs)
3. SHINY DIME: The central idea, crystal clear (1 memorable sentence)
4. DEVELOPMENT: Examples, stories, data supporting the idea (body)
5. IMPLICATIONS: What changes if you accept this idea (2-3 paragraphs)
6. CLOSE: Reconnection to the hook or call-to-action (1-2 sentences)
```

### Application for [your brand] -- LinkedIn Post Example

```
HOOK: "We analyzed 10,000 hiring processes in SMBs.
The result? The best candidate was rejected in 34% of cases."

TENSION: "Not because they weren't good enough. But because their CV didn't contain
the right keywords. The paradox of modern recruiting: the tools designed
to find talent have become the main obstacle."

SHINY DIME: "Keyword matching is the equivalent of choosing
a restaurant only by the name of the dish, without tasting anything."

DEVELOPMENT: [Data, real example, how reasoning AI solves the problem]

CTA: "If you want to see how recruiting without keywords works,
the link is in the first comment."
```

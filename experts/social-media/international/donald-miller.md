## Core Philosophy

### The 5 Core Principles

**1. "If you confuse, you'll lose"**
Clarity beats creativity. If the message isn't immediate, the customer says no. The human brain burns 600-800 calories per day just processing information. When it encounters confusing information, it ignores it to conserve energy. Confusing marketing gets filtered as noise.

**2. The customer is the hero, not your brand**
> "Your customer should be the hero of the story, not your brand. This is the secret every phenomenally successful business understands."

The brand is the guide (Yoda), not the hero (Luke Skywalker). When you position yourself as the hero, you compete with the customer for the protagonist role. When you position yourself as the guide, the customer trusts you.

**3. People buy solutions to internal problems, not external ones**
> "Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems."

The external problem is the pretext. The internal problem (frustration, insecurity, inadequacy) is the real purchase driver.

**4. Story is the weapon against noise**
> "Story is the greatest weapon we have to combat noise, because it organizes information in such a way that people are compelled to listen."

Music is noise with structure. Story does the same with marketing: it transforms noise into something the brain can't ignore.

**5. The brain is wired for survival**
People pay attention only to what helps them survive and thrive. If your marketing doesn't clearly communicate how you help the customer be better off, it will be ignored. Every message must answer: "How does this help me survive and thrive?"

### How He Differs from Others
- **Compared to Seth Godin**: Miller is more structured and prescriptive. Godin gives you the philosophy; Miller gives you the template to fill in.
- **Compared to Gary Vee**: Miller doesn't push for content volume but for message clarity. One clear message beats 100 confusing posts.
- **Compared to Simon Sinek**: Sinek works on the company's "why" (inside-out). Miller works on the customer's "why" (outside-in). The starting point is always the customer, never the brand.
- **Compared to Sabri Suby**: Suby is aggressive on direct response. Miller uses narrative to create relationship before the sale.
- **Unique quality**: Miller created a replicable framework (SB7 + BrandScript) that any company can use on its own. It's not theory — it's an operational template.

## Frameworks and Methodologies

### SB7 - StoryBrand 7-Part Framework

The complete formula:
> "A Character who wants something encounters a Problem before they can get it. At the peak of their despair, a Guide steps into their lives, gives them a Plan, and Calls them to Action. That action helps them avoid Failure and ends in a Success."

---

#### 1. A Character (The Hero)

**Principle**: The hero of the story is your customer. Never your brand.

**How to apply it**:
- Identify WHO your ideal customer is
- Define WHAT they want (a specific and concrete desire)
- The desire must be clear and measurable

**Critical rule**: Define ONE desire only. When you ask the customer to focus on more than one idea, you lose them. The desire must open a "story gap" — the distance between where the customer is now and where they want to be.

**Key question**: "What does my customer want in the context of my product/service?"

*Example*: For a B2B SaaS like Slack, the hero is the team leader drowning in email. Their desire: to communicate quickly and in an organized way. For [your brand], identify WHO your hero is and WHAT they want.

---

#### 2. Has a Problem (The Problem)

**Principle**: The problem is the hook of the story. Without a problem, there's no story.

Miller identifies **three levels of problem**, all of which need to be mapped:

**External Problem** (the tangible, visible problem)
- The physical, practical problem the customer needs to solve
- It's the symptom, not the disease
- Generic example: "I have 200 resumes on my desk and don't know where to start"

**Internal Problem** (the emotional, hidden problem)
- How the external problem makes the customer FEEL
- Frustration, inadequacy, stress, fear of making a mistake, guilt
- THIS is the real purchase driver
- Generic example: "I feel overwhelmed. I'm not good enough. I'm afraid of making a bad hire."

**Philosophical Problem** (the principled, universal problem)
- Something that "shouldn't be this way" — an injustice
- The formula is: "It's not right that [unjust situation]"
- It connects the customer to a larger cause
- Generic example: "An HR manager shouldn't be doing data entry. They should be doing strategy."

**The Villain**
Miller suggests personifying the problem as a villain. The villain must be:
- A root cause, not a symptom
- Something recognizable and relatable
- Real, not invented

*Example for a B2B SaaS*:
- **Villain**: The old way of doing things in your industry (e.g., for Slack: the endless email; for Canva: expensive and complex design)
- **External**: The tangible problem — "I spend hours doing [unproductive activity]"
- **Internal**: How the customer feels — "I feel frustrated, inadequate, behind compared to competitors"
- **Philosophical**: The injustice — "It's not right that a professional spends 70% of their time doing [busywork] instead of [strategic work]"

---

#### 3. And Meets a Guide (The Guide)

**Principle**: The customer isn't looking for another hero. They're looking for a guide to help them win.

The guide must express two qualities:

**Empathy** — "I understand you"
- Show that you understand the customer's problem
- It's not enough to say "we're experts" — you need to say "we know what it's like"
- Formula: "We know what it means to [customer's problem]..."
- Empathy creates emotional trust

**Authority** — "I can help you"
- Demonstrate you have the expertise to solve the problem
- Expressed through: testimonials, statistics, awards, client logos, years of experience
- Don't brag: show results, not yourself
- Authority creates rational trust

**Critical combination**: Empathy without authority = useless compassion. Authority without empathy = arrogance. You need both.

**Analogy**: Think of Yoda in Star Wars. Yoda has empathy (understands Luke's fear) and authority (he's a Jedi Master). He doesn't try to be the hero — he helps the hero win.

*Example for a B2B SaaS*:
- **Empathy**: "We know what it means to [the customer's daily pain]. We know that time wasted on [busywork] is time stolen from [valuable work]." — Slack: "We know what it means to get lost in endless email chains"
- **Authority**: Concrete numbers (users served, measurable results, testimonials from notable clients), differentiating technology, team credentials

---

#### 4. Who Gives Them a Plan (The Plan)

**Principle**: Customers need a clear path. Uncertainty generates anxiety, and anxiety blocks the purchase.

Miller identifies **two types of plan**:

**Process Plan** (how it works, in 3 steps)
- Max 3-4 steps. If you need more, group them.
- Each step must be simple and doable
- Reduces "cognitive load" and makes action easy
- Formula: "1. You do X. 2. We do Y. 3. You get Z."

**Agreement Plan** (risk reduction)
- A list of commitments/guarantees that eliminate fear
- Example: "Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back", "No contract lock-in", "Setup in 24 hours"
- Reduces the perception of risk

*Example for a B2B SaaS (Process Plan)*:
1. **[Simple customer action]** — e.g., "Create your workspace in 2 minutes"
2. **[The product does the work]** — e.g., "Our system organizes everything automatically"
3. **[The customer gets the result]** — e.g., "Start working with the team seamlessly"

*Example for a B2B SaaS (Agreement Plan)*:
- "Setup in less than 24 hours"
- "No long-term commitment"
- "Your data stays yours, always"
- "Free trial on a real case"

---

#### 5. And Calls Them to Action (The Call to Action)

**Principle**: Customers don't act unless you ask them to. Passivity kills sales.

Miller distinguishes two CTAs:

**Direct CTA** (the marriage proposal)
- It's the explicit purchase request
- Must be visible, clear, repeated
- Examples: "Book a demo", "Start now", "Try free"
- Don't hide it. Don't be timid. Repeat it multiple times on the page.
- The button should be a different color from the rest of the page

**Transitional CTA** (the first date)
- For those not ready to buy, offer value in exchange for an email
- Examples: "Download the guide", "Take the quiz", "Watch the webinar"
- Build the relationship before the sale
- It's the lead magnet that feeds the funnel

**Miller's analogy**: If the direct CTA is "Will you marry me?", the transitional CTA is "Would you like to go to dinner with me?"

*Example for a B2B SaaS*:
- **Direct CTA**: "Try [your brand] free" / "Book a 15-minute demo" — Notion: "Start for free", Slack: "Try for free"
- **Transitional CTA**: "Download the guide: 5 mistakes [your target] makes in [area]" / "Quiz: How much [time/money] are you losing on [problem]?"

---

#### 6. That Helps Them Avoid Failure (The Stakes)

**Principle**: If there's no risk, there's no story. The customer must understand what they lose by not acting.

**The salt rule**: Failure is like salt in cooking. A pinch is enough. Too much makes the message repulsive (fear-mongering). The right dose creates urgency without anxiety.

**How to use it**:
- List 3-5 negative consequences of NOT acting
- Don't invent fears: use real ones
- Use them as contrast with success (step 7)

*Example for a B2B SaaS*:
- Losing clients/opportunities that end up with the competition
- Wasting resources on manual processes (calculate the specific cost in your industry)
- Falling behind while competitors automate
- Team burnout from operational overload
- Remaining a cost center instead of becoming a strategic business partner

---

#### 7. And Ends in Success (The Success / The Transformation)

**Principle**: Show the customer what life looks like AFTER using your product. Paint the "promised land" vividly.

Miller identifies **three types of success**:

**Winning power or position**
- Status, respect, recognition
- "The HR manager who brings A-players becomes a strategic partner to the CEO"

**Union / Completeness**
- Connection, belonging, collaboration
- "The HR team works in harmony, without chaos"

**Self-realization / Identity transformation**
- Who does the customer become after using the product?
- Formula "From... To...": From [current identity] to [aspirational identity]

**The "From / To" technique**:

| FROM (before [your brand]) | TO (after [your brand]) |
|---|---|
| Professional drowning in busywork | Strategic, focused professional |
| Frustrated, reactive team | Efficient, proactive team |
| Company losing opportunities | Company attracting opportunities |
| Decisions based on intuition | Decisions based on data |
| Operational | Strategic |

*Example for a B2B SaaS*:
- **Concrete success**: "Reduce [process] time by X%. Get [result] in [short timeframe], not [long timeframe]."
- **Identity transformation**: "From [painful current identity] to [aspirational identity]." — Slack: "From a team lost in emails to a team that communicates seamlessly"

---

### BrandScript — How to Fill It In

The BrandScript is the operational document that collects all 7 SB7 elements into a single sheet. It's the foundation for ALL marketing: website, email, social, pitch, presentations.

**BrandScript template (example filled in for a B2B SaaS)**:

```
HERO: [Your ideal customer — role, context, company size]

WANTS: [The specific and measurable desire in the context of your product]

EXTERNAL PROBLEM: [The tangible, practical problem]

INTERNAL PROBLEM: [How the problem makes the customer FEEL: frustration, inadequacy, stress]

PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM: [The injustice — "It's not right that [unjust situation]"]

VILLAIN: [The root cause of the problem — a process, a system, an old way of doing things]

GUIDE: [Your brand] — [your value proposition in one line]

EMPATHY: "We know what it means to [the customer's pain]."

AUTHORITY: [Numbers, testimonials, differentiating technology, credentials]

PLAN:
1. [Simple customer step]
2. [The product does the work]
3. [The customer gets the result]

DIRECT CTA: "Try [your brand] free"

TRANSITIONAL CTA: "Download the guide to [relevant topic]"

FAILURE:
- [Negative consequence 1 of NOT acting]
- [Negative consequence 2]
- [Negative consequence 3]

SUCCESS:
- [Concrete, measurable result]
- [Identity transformation: From "[current identity]" to "[aspirational identity]"]
```

### One-Liner — Formula and Examples

The One-Liner is the StoryBrand "elevator pitch." Three parts:

**Formula**: Problem + Solution + Result

It's not limited to one sentence: it can be 2-4 sentences, as long as it's memorable and clear.

**Rule**: Fill it in AFTER the BrandScript, because the BrandScript is the foundation.

**Generic examples**:
- Financial consultant: "Many people worry about not saving enough for retirement. We offer a personalized financial plan that brings order to the chaos. So you can look to the future with confidence, not anxiety."
- SaaS project management: "Teams waste hours in pointless meetings and endless emails. Our platform centralizes everything in one place. So your team works fewer hours and produces more results."

**One-Liner — Template for [your brand]**:

> "[Your target] wastes [time/resources] doing [painful process], risking [negative consequence]. [Your brand] uses [differentiating technology/approach] to [solution]. So [desired result] and [your target] can finally [aspiration]."

**Short version (for social/bio)**:

> "[Problem in 3 words]. [Your brand] uses [approach] to [result]. Less [pain], more [aspiration]."

*Slack example*: "Teams lost in email. Slack centralizes communication into organized channels. Less inbox, more productivity."

**Where to use it**: Social bio, email signature, website header, first slide of a presentation, response to "What do you do?", elevator pitch.

---

### Marketing Made Simple — 5-Step Funnel

Miller's funnel is based on **three relational stages**: Curiosity -> Enlightenment -> Commitment.

#### Step 1: One-Liner
- Your hook phrase (see above)
- Use it everywhere: social, email signature, networking, bio
- Goal: generate curiosity in 10 seconds

#### Step 2: Website (StoryBrand Wireframe)
The site must follow a precise structure with **9 sections**:

1. **Header**: What you do + clear CTA + image of success. The customer must understand in 5 seconds what you offer and how it improves their life.
2. **Stakes**: What happens if they DON'T act? Justify the cost of inaction.
3. **Value Proposition**: 3-4 clear benefits with icons/bullets. Not features: benefits.
4. **The Guide**: Who you are, with empathy ("We understand your problem") and authority (logos, numbers, testimonials).
5. **The Plan**: The 3 steps to work with you. Simple, visual.
6. **Explanatory Paragraph**: The BrandScript in long form (2-3 paragraphs telling the complete story).
7. **Video (optional)**: Demo, testimonial, or explanation in 60-90 seconds.
8. **Price / Lead Magnet**: Clear offer or transitional CTA.
9. **Junk Drawer (Footer)**: Everything else — secondary links, legal, contacts.

**Website rule**: The CTA button must appear AT LEAST 3 times on the page. Different color from the rest.

#### Step 3: Lead Generator (the magnet)
- A PDF, quiz, webinar, or checklist you offer for free in exchange for an email
- Must solve a micro-problem for the customer
- Effective titles according to Miller: "5 mistakes you're making in [area]", "3 ways to [get result]", "The definitive guide to [topic]"
- Ideal length: 1,000-1,500 words for a PDF

*Example for a B2B SaaS*: "Free guide: The 5 most costly mistakes in [area] (and how to avoid them)" or "Quiz: How much [time/money] are you losing on [process]? Calculate your hidden cost." HubSpot excels with its "Website Grader" and "Marketing Grader" as lead magnets

#### Step 4: Nurture Email Campaign
- Automated weekly emails after the lead magnet download
- Goal: deliver value, build trust, stay top-of-mind
- Content: tips, blog post links, videos, case studies, insights
- DON'T sell. Deliver value. Be generous.
- Frequency: 1 email/week
- The relationship is built through consistency

*Example for a B2B SaaS*: Weekly series with industry tips, market data, common mistakes, tech trends, mini case studies. Like Buffer's "Buffer Blog Weekly" newsletter or HubSpot's newsletter.

#### Step 5: Sales Email Campaign
- Series of 5-7 emails focused on conversion
- Triggered after a specific event (e.g., after 4 weeks of nurture, or after a specific action)
- Typical structure:
  1. Email describing the problem
  2. Email presenting the solution
  3. Email with testimonial / case study
  4. Email overcoming objections
  5. Email with urgency / limited offer
  6. Closing email with direct CTA
- Here you ask for the sale. Clearly. Without shame.

## How to Apply to Your Brand

### Full SB7 Application for Your B2B/SaaS Brand

**The mistake to avoid**: [Your brand] shouldn't talk about itself ("We have advanced technology", "We're innovative"). It should talk about the customer and their problem. Technology is the tool, not the story.

**The right story (template)**:
"You're a [your customer's role] at [context]. Every [time period] you have to [painful activity]. You don't have time for [what they'd rather do]. You know that [missed opportunity], but you can't [result]. You feel [negative emotion]. You feel like you should be doing [strategic work], not [busywork]. It's not right. We understand this frustration. We built a tool that [solution]. Our plan is simple: [3 steps]. If you don't act, you'll keep [negative consequence]. If you do, you become [aspirational identity]."

*Slack example*: "You're a team leader at a startup. Every day you lose hours to email, endless threads, and meetings to align the team. You don't have time to do the real work. We get it. Slack centralizes everything into organized channels. The plan is simple: create the workspace, invite the team, start communicating. If you don't act, you'll keep losing hours in your inbox. If you do, your team works better and you lead."

### The Three Levels of Problem — How to Map Them for [Your Brand]

| Level | Question to ask yourself | Implication for messaging |
|---|---|---|
| **External** | What is the tangible, practical problem my customer needs to solve? | Feature-level: what [your brand] SOLVES operationally |
| **Internal** | How does my customer FEEL because of this problem? | Emotional-level: what the customer EXPERIENCES. This is where you win the sale |
| **Philosophical** | What is the injustice? What "shouldn't be this way"? | Purpose-level: the larger cause [your brand] contributes to |

**Miller's golden rule**: Sell the solution to the INTERNAL problem. The external is the pretext. The internal is the engine.

### How to Fill in the BrandScript for [Your Brand]
(See the BrandScript section above for the template to fill in)

### How to Create [Your Brand]'s One-Liner
(See the One-Liner section above for the template)

### How to Use "From / To" in Content

Every post, video, or email can use this structure:

**Hook**: Describe the "FROM" (the customer's current painful situation)
**Body**: Show the bridge (what you do, how it works)
**Close**: Paint the "TO" (the transformation, the promised land)

Generic post example:
> "FROM: Monday morning. [Specific painful scenario for your target]. Zero certainty.
> TO: Monday morning. [Your brand] has already [solved the problem]. [Concrete result]. You open your coffee and [do the valuable work]."

---

## Hook and Virality Techniques

### How Miller Captures Attention

**1. Always open with the problem**
Never start by talking about yourself or your product. Start with the customer's problem. The problem is the hook. If the customer doesn't recognize themselves in the problem, they won't listen to the solution.

Example: NOT "[your brand] is a tool for [X]" BUT "Are you losing [something valuable] because [problem the customer recognizes]?"

**2. Create a "story gap"**
The distance between where the customer is now and where they want to be generates narrative tension. The human brain is programmed to want to close gaps. Open the gap, and the audience will stay to find out how to close it.

Example: "67% of SMEs hire the wrong person at least once a year. The cost? Up to 50% of the annual salary. But there is a way to drastically reduce this risk..."

**3. Use the "survival brain" rule**
The brain pays attention to what helps it survive and thrive. Connect your message to:
- Conserving resources (time, money)
- Conserving social status (reputation, respect)
- Conserving relationships (team, boss's trust)

**4. Clarity > Creativity**
Don't be clever. Be clear. A clear headline beats a creative headline 100% of the time. "How to find the right candidate in 3 days" beats "Rethink the future of talent with AI innovation."

### Recurring Narrative Patterns

**Pattern 1: Problem -> Agitation -> Solution (StoryBrand-adapted PAS)**
1. Present the external problem
2. Agitate the internal problem (how does it make you feel?)
3. Present the guide and the solution

**Pattern 2: Before -> Bridge -> After**
1. Show the painful "before"
2. Show the bridge (the 3-step plan)
3. Show the desirable "after"

**Pattern 3: Villain -> Guide -> Victory**
1. Identify the villain (manual screening, keyword-based ATS)
2. Present the guide ([your brand] with empathy + authority)
3. Show the victory (transformation)

**Pattern 4: "What if..." (Hypothetical)**
1. "What if you could reduce screening time by 75%?"
2. Describe how
3. CTA

### How to Use Narrative Structure for Video/Post Hooks

**For short-form video (Reel/TikTok)**:
- **Second 1-3**: Open with the internal problem ("Have you ever felt overwhelmed by resumes?")
- **Second 3-8**: Escalate ("And the best part is, you know you're losing good candidates")
- **Second 8-15**: Present the guide ("Here's what SMEs that solved this are doing")
- **Second 15-25**: Show the plan (3 simple steps)
- **Second 25-30**: CTA + success ("Try free / the result")

**For LinkedIn posts**:
- **Line 1**: Hook with an external problem or shocking data (story gap)
- **Lines 2-3**: Internal problem (how the reader feels)
- **Body**: The guide presents the plan
- **Close**: Success + CTA

**For Instagram carousels**:
- **Slide 1**: Problem (the hook)
- **Slides 2-3**: Agitation of the internal problem + villain
- **Slide 4**: The guide (empathy)
- **Slides 5-6**: The plan (3 steps)
- **Slide 7**: Failure vs Success (contrast)
- **Slide 8**: Direct CTA + transitional CTA

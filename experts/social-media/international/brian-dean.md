# Brian Dean

## Profile

### Who He Is
Brian Dean is an American entrepreneur and SEO strategist, founder of **Backlinko** and co-founder of **Exploding Topics**. Success Magazine called him "the world's foremost expert on search engine optimization". His work has been cited by Forbes, Inc. Magazine, Entrepreneur, HubSpot, and hundreds of industry blogs.

### Background
- **Education**: Degree in Nutrition from the University of Rhode Island, master's from Tufts University (2007). No formal marketing background — entirely self-taught.
- **Journey**: After his master's, he left academia in 2008 to sell a nutrition ebook online. He failed with his first 5 online businesses before finding the right formula in 2010 with a personal finance site.
- **Backlinko (2012-2022)**: Founded the blog to teach SEO and link building with a radically different approach — fewer pieces of content, but of exceptional quality. Sold to **Semrush in January 2022** for a mid-seven-figure sum.
- **Exploding Topics (2019-2024)**: A SaaS platform that identifies emerging trends before they blow up, using proprietary algorithms. Also acquired by **Semrush in 2024**.

### Key Numbers
| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Backlinko monthly traffic | ~500,000 unique visitors/month (at the time of sale) |
| Visitors per single post | Up to 1.2M visitors on a single article |
| Newsletter subscribers | 170,000+ |
| YouTube subscribers | 350,000+ |
| Monthly YouTube views | 77,000+ views/month |
| New YouTube subscribers per month | ~1,700/month |
| Total published posts | ~53 articles (to reach 4M visitors) |
| Average post length | ~3,000 words |
| Twitter/X followers | 100,000+ |

The most impressive figure: **4 million visitors with only 53 articles**. This is the living manifesto of his "quality over quantity" approach.

## Core Philosophy

### The 5 Core Principles

#### 1. Quality Over Quantity (Publish Less, But Better)
Brian publishes roughly **1 article every 4 weeks**. Each piece is a definitive resource — researched, graphically designed, and optimized over weeks. His thesis: in content marketing, a single 10x piece of content is worth more than 50 mediocre ones.

> "The biggest mistake I see people make is focusing on quantity over quality."

#### 2. Data-Backed Content
Every claim is supported by studies, original research, or case studies. Brian has conducted studies on millions of search results (1M Google results, 1.3M YouTube videos) to validate his strategies. He doesn't rely on opinions — he relies on evidence.

#### 3. Content Promotion > Content Creation
Brian coined the expression **"Publish and Pray"** to describe the mistake of creating content without a promotion plan. His philosophy: 20% of the work is creating the content, 80% is promoting it strategically.

> "SEO isn't about content creation. It's about content promotion."

#### 4. Engineer Content for Links (Design for Sharing)
Every piece of content is designed from the start to attract backlinks and shares. It's not a side effect — it's the primary goal of the content's structure itself. That's why he created concepts like "Linkreators" and "Share Triggers".

#### 5. User Experience First (UX Determines Ranking)
Google measures how long users spend on the page (Dwell Time). Short paragraphs, clean design, bucket brigades, custom images: everything is optimized to keep the reader glued.

> "Google doesn't care how much time and effort you put into your content. They care about the user experience."

### How He Differs from Others
- **Vs. Neil Patel**: Neil publishes daily and covers everything; Brian publishes rarely, but each piece is a masterclass.
- **Vs. Moz/Ahrefs blog**: More oriented toward the individual practitioner than the team; his content is personal, with first-person storytelling and case studies.
- **Vs. HubSpot**: HubSpot bets on volume and generic inbound; Brian is surgical about SEO and link building with replicable frameworks.
- **Unique approach**: He transformed SEO from a technical discipline into a copywriting and design discipline, proving that the best content always wins.

## Frameworks and Methodologies

### 1. Skyscraper Technique

Brian Dean's most famous framework. He first used it to double his site traffic in less than 2 weeks (+110%).

**Step-by-step:**

**Step 1 — Find an existing "linkable asset"**
- Search for content in your industry that has already attracted many backlinks
- Use Ahrefs, Semrush, or BuzzSumo to find the most-linked content
- Identify high-volume keywords with existing mediocre content

**Step 2 — Create something significantly better**
Improve across 4 dimensions:
- **Length**: If the competitor has 25 tips, you include 50
- **Freshness**: Update outdated data, screenshots, and statistics
- **Design**: Invest in custom graphics, infographics, and professional layout
- **Depth**: Don't just list — explain the "how" and "why" with actionable details

**Step 3 — Targeted outreach**
- Find who has already linked to the original content (competitor backlink analysis)
- Contact them with a personalized email showcasing your improved content
- The logic: if they've already linked to similar content, they're predisposed to link to a better version
- Focus on pitch quality, not quantity

**Why it works**: It leverages a psychological principle — people want to link to the best available resource on a topic. If you create that resource, the links come.

### 2. Content Upgrade

A technique for increasing email conversions from 0.5% to 5%+ on every single post.

**What it is**: A bonus piece of content specific to that individual article, offered in exchange for an email. Not a generic lead magnet, but a hyper-relevant upgrade.

**Brian's case study:**
- Post on Google's 200 ranking factors: conversion rate 0.4%
- After adding a Content Upgrade (checklist of the 10 most important factors): conversion rate **5.5%**
- Overall result: **+785% conversions in a single day**

**How to implement it:**
1. Identify your most-visited post
2. Create a bonus specific to that post (checklist, template, summary PDF, swipe file)
3. Insert the CTA **in the middle of the content** (not just at the end)
4. Have a professional design made for the bonus
5. Repeat for every high-traffic article

**Why it works**: It's hyper-contextual (inside the post), hyper-relevant (on the same topic), and hyper-valuable (adds value to the content the reader is already consuming).

---

### 3. Power Page

A "Power Page" is a piece of content strategically designed to rank #1 on Google and attract backlinks and social shares.

**Key elements:**
- **Linkreators**: Influential people in your industry who have the power to create links. The Power Page is designed for them, not just for the general reader.
- **Share Triggers**: Psychological principles built into the content that increase the likelihood of sharing.
- **Search Intent Alignment**: The content answers exactly what the user is searching for.

**Main Share Triggers:**
- **Practical Value**: Content with immediate practical value gets shared more
- **Awe Factor**: Long-form, in-depth content (3,000+ words) generates a sense of "wow" — a study of 100M articles found that those over 3,000 words receive more shares
- **Social Currency**: Content that makes the person sharing it look smart

**Content Frameworks for Power Pages:**
1. **Go-To Guidebook**: The definitive guide containing everything about a specific topic
2. **Expanded List Post**: An expanded list with actionable details for each point
3. **AwardsBait Framework**: Content designed to leverage Linkreators' egos (e.g., "The 20 best experts in...")
4. **The Trademark Technique**: Creating an original name for a strategy (like "Skyscraper Technique") that becomes quotable and linkable

---

### 4. YouTube SEO Framework

Based on a study of **1.3 million YouTube videos**.

**YouTube ranking factors discovered by Brian:**
| Factor | Correlation with ranking |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Comments | Strong positive correlation |
| Video length | First-page videos average **14 min 50 sec** |
| Total views | Significant correlation |
| Shares | Strong correlation |
| Likes | Significant correlation |

**Practical strategy:**
1. Keyword research with YouTube Suggest and tools like TubeBuddy
2. Optimized title with the main keyword at the beginning
3. Long description (250+ words) with natural keywords
4. Relevant tags (main keyword + variations)
5. High-contrast custom thumbnail
6. Encourage comments with direct questions at the end of the video
7. Create longer and more in-depth videos than competitors (the average first-page video is nearly 15 minutes long)

---

### 5. APP Formula for Intros (Video and Text)

**A**gree — **P**romise — **P**review

A framework for writing introductions that capture attention in the first 5 seconds.

**Agree:**
Start with a statement the reader/viewer agrees with. Show that you understand their problem.
> Example: "You know that creating LinkedIn content is frustrating — you publish every day and nobody engages."

**Promise:**
Show a way out. Give a glimpse of a better world.
> Example: "Well, there's a technique I used to triple my engagement in 30 days."

**Preview:**
Briefly preview what they'll find in the content.
> Example: "In this post I'll show you the exact 5 steps I followed, with screenshots and real results."

**Why it works**: The Agree creates rapport, the Promise generates curiosity, the Preview gives a reason to stay. The reader feels understood and motivated to continue.

---

### 6. Copywriting for Engagement

#### Bucket Brigades
Words and phrases that act as "bridges" to pull the reader from one paragraph to the next. Brian borrowed them from the direct-response copywriting world.

**List of the most effective Bucket Brigades:**
- "Here's the deal:"
- "The best part?"
- "It gets better:"
- "Bottom line?"
- "But here's the kicker:"
- "You might be wondering:"
- "Want to know the secret?"
- "Here's why that matters:"
- "Let me explain..."
- "This is crazy:"
- "Look:"
- "And the best part is..."

**Practical rule**: Insert a Bucket Brigade every 3-4 paragraphs. Vary the type to maintain rhythm.

**Result**: Brian achieves an **average time on page of over 3 minutes** — exceptional for 3,000+ word content.

#### Pattern Interrupt
Visual and textual techniques to break monotony and recapture attention:
- **Ultra-short paragraphs** (1-2 lines max, even on 6,000-word posts)
- **Images and screenshots** every 200-300 words
- **Colored boxes** to highlight key concepts
- **Frequent subheadings** that function as mini-headlines
- **Strategic bold** on key phrases (not on everything)
- **Rhetorical questions** that reactivate the reader's attention

#### Short, punchy intros
- Never more than 3-6 lines for the introduction
- The intro should only reassure the reader they're in the right place and preview the value

## How to Apply to Your Brand

### 1. Create definitive HR content that outperforms competitors

**Direct application of the Skyscraper Technique to HR:**

1. **Research**: Identify the most-linked and most-shared Italian HR content (e.g., onboarding guides, job description templates, hiring guides)
2. **Gap analysis**: Find where competitors (Factorial, Personio blog, Dipendenti in Cloud) fall short — outdated data, generic advice, no Italian case studies
3. **10x creation**: Create the definitive version with:
   - Updated data on the Italian job market
   - Downloadable ready-to-use templates
   - Real case studies from Italian SMEs
   - Original infographics
   - Integrated explainer videos
4. **Outreach**: Contact HR bloggers, labor consultants, and industry associations that have linked to similar content

**Concrete example**: If the best article on "how to write an effective job description" has 1,500 words and 5 generic templates, [your brand] creates "The Definitive Guide to Job Descriptions for Italian SMEs" with 4,000 words, 15 industry-specific templates, ISTAT labor market data, and an integrated AI tool to generate them.

### 2. Skyscraper applied: HR guides that outperform competitors

**Top 5 Power Pages that [your brand] should create:**

| Topic | Target keyword | Differentiating angle |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| Complete onboarding guide for SMEs | "employee onboarding" | With AI-powered checklist and templates for the first 90 days |
| How to write job postings that attract talent | "effective job posting" | With real A/B tests and conversion rate data |
| The real cost of a bad hire | "employee turnover cost" | With an interactive calculator for Italian SMEs |
| Guide to structured interviews | "job interview questions" | With downloadable scorecards and AI framework |
| Employer branding for SMEs with no budget | "SME employer branding" | With 20 zero-cost tactics tested on Italian companies |

### 3. Copywriting techniques for LinkedIn hooks

**APP Formula adapted for [your brand] LinkedIn posts:**

**Example post — Agree, Promise, Preview:**
> **[Agree]** You spend weeks searching for candidates and then the good ones accept another offer.
>
> **[Promise]** There's a specific reason why this happens. And once you understand it, your time-to-fill drops by half.
>
> **[Preview]** I'm going to share 3 mistakes that 90% of Italian SMEs make in their hiring process (and how to fix them in 48 hours).

### 4. Bucket Brigades and Pattern Interrupt for text posts

**Bucket Brigades adapted for LinkedIn:**
- "But here's the thing..."
- "The best part is coming."
- "I'll be honest with you:"
- "And here comes the surprise."
- "The real question is:"
- "Result?"
- "Think about it for a second."
- "But wait."
- "I know what you're thinking."

**Pattern Interrupt for LinkedIn posts:**
- Empty line every 1-2 sentences (LinkedIn is not a blog article)
- Strategic emoji at the start of a section (max 1-2 per post)
- A number or surprising data point as a visual interruption
- Direct question to the reader every 3-4 lines
- One-word sentence as a paragraph ("Exactly." / "Zero." / "Wrong.")

**Example post with Bucket Brigades:**
> 67% of Italian SMEs lose the ideal candidate.
>
> Not because of salary.
> Not because of location.
>
> Because of the hiring process.
>
> Let me explain.
>
> The average candidate today is in 3 interview processes simultaneously.
> If your process takes 4 weeks, you've already lost.
>
> Here's the thing:
>
> You don't need another recruiter.
> You need a smarter process.
>
> The best part?
>
> AI can reduce your screening time from 2 weeks to 2 hours.
> Without losing quality. In fact, improving it.
>
> The real question is:
> How much is it costing you to keep recruiting like it's 2015?

### 5. Power Page for key HR topics

**Typical Power Page structure for your brand:**

1. **Magnetic title** with a specific number and clear benefit
   - E.g.: "SME Recruiting: The Complete 2026 Guide (with 47 Free Templates)"
2. **APP intro** (3-5 lines max)
3. **Clickable Table of Contents**
4. **Sections with H2/H3** optimized for search intent
5. **Content Upgrade** integrated mid-article (checklist, template, tool)
6. **Italian data and statistics** (ISTAT, Unioncamere, observatories)
7. **Case studies** from Italian SMEs
8. **"Pro Tip" boxes** with advanced advice
9. **Final CTA** toward demo/free trial of [your brand]
10. **Related resources** (internal links to other [your brand] content)

## Hook and Virality Techniques

### How Brian Dean Captures Attention

2. **Personal case study as a hook**: Always opens with a concrete result he achieved first-hand
3. **Problem -> Agitation -> Solution**: Makes you feel the pain of the problem before offering a way out

5. **"This is exactly..."**: Uses specificity as a lever for credibility

### APP Formula Applied to [your brand] Videos

### Recurring Patterns in High-Virality Content

| Pattern | Psychological mechanism | Example for [your brand] |

| Specific number + result | Credibility and curiosity | "How 47 SMEs reduced turnover by 34%" |
| Counterintuitive | Cognitive surprise | "The more job postings you publish, the fewer qualified candidates you get" |
| "The truth about..." | Revelation and insider knowledge | "The truth about how SMEs hire in Italy (real data)" |
| List with odd number | Perception of authentic completeness | "7 mistakes your recruiter makes every day" |
| Before/After | Tangible transformation | "Before: 45 days to hire. After: 12 days. Here's how." |

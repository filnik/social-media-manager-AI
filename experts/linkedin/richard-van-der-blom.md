## Core Philosophy

### The 5 Fundamental Principles

**1. "Data over opinions"**
On LinkedIn, everyone has an opinion on "what works." Van der Blom has the DATA. Every recommendation he makes is based on the analysis of hundreds of thousands of real posts, not anecdotes or gut feelings.

**2. "The algorithm rewards relevance, not reach"**
The LinkedIn algorithm doesn't distribute content to as many people as possible. It distributes it to the MOST RELEVANT people. The quality of engagement (deep comments, saves, shares) matters more than quantity.

**3. "Dwell time is the hidden metric"**
LinkedIn measures how long people spend reading your post. A post read for 30 seconds by 100 people performs better than a post read for 2 seconds by 1,000 people. The ability to hold attention is crucial.

**4. "Consistency compounds, virality fades"**
The data shows that those who publish consistently (3-5 times/week) for months achieve better results than those who chase viral posts. Virality is a spike. Consistency is a ramp.

**5. "Native always wins"**
LinkedIn rewards native content (text, images, directly uploaded video, PDF/carousels) and penalizes external links. Every piece of content must live INSIDE LinkedIn, not redirect elsewhere.

### How He Differs from Others
- **Pure data-driven**: No opinions, no anecdotes — data on millions of posts
- **Public annual research**: The report is available to everyone, creating a common good
- **Cross-country**: The data covers 50+ countries, showing the algorithm works globally
- **Continuous updates**: Publishes updates throughout the year when the algorithm changes
- **Practical + scientific**: Transforms data into concrete, actionable recommendations

## Frameworks and Methodologies

### 1. The LinkedIn Algorithm — How It Works (from the Data)

**Phase 1 — Initial Distribution (0-90 minutes)**
- LinkedIn shows the post to a small sample of your network (about 5-10%)
- Measures: "see more" clicks, reading time (dwell time), reactions, comments
- If signals are positive, it expands distribution

**Phase 2 — Extended Distribution (90 min - 24 hours)**
- The post is shown to a larger portion of your network
- Comments weigh more than likes (roughly 4-5x)
- Shares weigh more than comments
- Saves are a very strong signal (relatively new)

**Phase 3 — Viral Distribution (24 hours+)**
- If the post exceeds thresholds, it's shown beyond the direct network
- Appears in the feeds of 2nd and 3rd degree connections
- May enter "Trending" notifications or editorial sections

**Phase 4 — Long Tail (days/weeks)**
- Posts with high initial engagement continue to receive views for days
- The "long tail" is longer than most people think

**Factors that INCREASE distribution:**
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Comments (especially long ones) | +++ |
| High dwell time | +++ |
| Saves | ++ |
| "See more" clicks | ++ |
| Shares with comment | ++ |
| Reactions (like, applause, etc.) | + |
| Author's replies to comments | ++ |

**Factors that REDUCE distribution:**
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| External links in the post | --- |
| Editing the post in the first 2 hours | -- |
| Tagging people who don't interact | - |
| Excessive hashtags (>5) | - |
| Posts that are too short (<50 characters) | - |

> *Example*: To maximize a post's reach, the strategy is: (1) strong hook for the "see more" click, (2) long content for dwell time, (3) closing question to stimulate comments, (4) reply to every comment in the first 2 hours, (5) no link in the post (put it in the first comment).

### 2. Format Performance (2024 Data)

**Format ranking by average reach (individual profiles):**

| Format | Relative Reach | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Document/PDF (carousel)** | Very high | The format with the highest dwell time. 8-12 slides ideal |
| **Long text (>1200 characters)** | High | The LinkedIn "classic." Works when well structured |
| **Native video** | High (growing) | LinkedIn is pushing video. Subtitles mandatory |
| **Poll** | Medium-high | Easy engagement but low quality conversation |
| **Text + single image** | Medium | The image slows scrolling but doesn't always add value |
| **Short text (<300 characters)** | Low | Too little dwell time for the algorithm |
| **Link share** | Low | The algorithm penalizes links. Always in the first comment |
| **Re-share without comment** | Very low | Nearly useless. If sharing, ALWAYS add your own comment |

**Key insights from 2024 data:**
- Carousels/PDFs generate 2-3x the reach of text-only posts
- Native video is growing rapidly (+40% year over year)
- Posts with a link in the body have -40% reach compared to posts without a link
- Posts with 3-5 hashtags perform better than those with 0 or 10+
- The ideal post length is between 800 and 1500 characters

### 3. Operational Rules for Maximizing Reach

**Timing:**
| Day | Best time (Europe) | Notes |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| Tuesday | 7:30-8:30 AM | Best day overall |
| Wednesday | 7:30-8:30 AM | Second best day |
| Thursday | 7:30-8:30 AM | Third best day |
| Monday | 8:00-9:00 AM | Good but people are in "catch-up mode" |
| Friday | 7:30-8:30 AM | Good in the morning, drops in the afternoon |
| Weekend | Avoid | Significantly lower reach |

**Optimal frequency:**
- **Individual profiles**: 3-5 posts/week (sweet spot for consistency without saturation)
- **Company page**: 2-4 posts/week
- **Never more than 1 post/day**: LinkedIn penalizes multiple posts on the same day
- **Minimum gap between posts**: 18-24 hours

**Engagement strategy:**
- Reply to ALL comments within the first 2 hours
- Every reply you give is a "boost" for the algorithm
- Comment on 5-10 other people's posts BEFORE publishing yours
- Don't edit the post in the first 2 hours after publishing

**Hashtags:**
- 3-5 hashtags per post (sweet spot)
- Mix of hashtags: 1-2 broad (#HR, #Recruiting), 2-3 specific (#ResumeScreening, #AIforHR)
- Place them at the end of the post, not in the middle
- Never more than 5: each extra hashtag reduces reach

> *Example*: Optimal schedule for a B2B brand: Tuesday (long educational post), Wednesday (carousel/PDF), Thursday (founder story), publishing at 8:00 AM with active engagement in the first 2 hours.

### 4. Company Page vs Personal Profile (Data)

**The data speaks clearly:**
- Personal profiles have **5-10x the organic reach** of company pages
- Posts from personal profiles generate **3x more engagement** than company posts
- Company pages are useful for: SEO, brand credibility, job postings, employer branding

**The recommended strategy:**
1. Founders/employees publish content on THEIR personal profiles
2. The company page publishes institutional content (case studies, news, jobs)
3. Employees interact with company page posts (engagement boost)
4. Don't duplicate the same content on profile and page

> *Example*: Your brand's founders should be the primary voice on LinkedIn (personal profile). The company page is support: publishes case studies, announcements, institutional content. The bulk of the "algorithmic work" is done by personal profiles.

## How to Apply to Your Brand

### 1. Data-driven strategy

Apply van der Blom's data to your LinkedIn strategy:
- **Format**: Alternate carousel/PDF (high reach) + long text (high engagement) + video (growing)
- **Timing**: Publish Tuesday-Thursday, 7:30-8:30 AM
- **Frequency**: 3-5 posts/week from founders' profiles
- **Engagement**: Reply to all comments within 2 hours

### 2. Zero links in the post

The data is unequivocal: -40% reach with a link in the body.
- All CTAs in the first comment or in bio
- If you must share a link, use the formula: value post + "Link in the first comment"

### 3. Carousels as a signature format

Carousels have the highest reach. For a B2B brand:
- "5 resume screening mistakes" (educational)
- "Keyword matching vs AI reasoning in 5 slides" (comparison)
- "The selection process in 5 steps" (how-to)

## Hook and Virality Techniques

### What the Data Says About Hooks

**Van der Blom's data on high-performance posts shows:**
1. 65% of viral posts have a hook based on specific numbers
2. Rhetorical questions in the title increase "see more" clicks by 30%
3. Counterintuitive statements generate 2x the comments
4. Posts with a "list" in the hook ("5 mistakes," "3 lessons") have above-average reach

### Data-Driven Patterns
1. **Specific number — Insight — Framework**: Numbers capture attention because they promise concreteness
2. **Industry data point — Strong opinion — Question**: Data creates credibility, opinion creates engagement
3. **Educational carousel — CTA in comment**: Maximum reach + maximum conversion

## Memorable Quotes and Concepts

### On the Algorithm
> **"LinkedIn rewards conversations, not broadcasts. The brands that engage win."**

> **"The algorithm doesn't care about your brand. It cares about your audience's reaction."**

### On Data
> **"Everyone has an opinion about LinkedIn. I have data."**

### Quotable Concepts for Your Brand
- "Your LinkedIn post has 90 minutes to prove its value. The algorithm decides in that time whether to show it to 100 or 10,000 people."
- "Put the link in the first comment. -40% reach isn't an opinion. It's data."
- "Carousels generate 2-3x the reach of text posts. If you're not using them, you're leaving visibility on the table."

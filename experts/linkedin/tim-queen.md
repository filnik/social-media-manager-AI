## Core Philosophy

### The 5 Fundamental Principles

**1. "Carousel is king on LinkedIn"**
The data shows that carousels (document post/PDF) are the format with the highest engagement and reach on LinkedIn. They combine visual appeal, interactivity, and high dwell time — everything the algorithm loves.

**2. "B2B content must educate first, sell never"**
In B2B, content that sells directly doesn't work. Content that educates, solves problems, and demonstrates expertise generates leads organically. Selling is the byproduct of value.

**3. "Screenspace is attention"**
The more space your content takes up in the feed, the more attention it captures. Carousels in US Letter format take up the maximum possible space in the LinkedIn feed, both vertically and horizontally.

**4. "System over creativity"**
Consistency on LinkedIn isn't achieved through spontaneous creativity. It's achieved through SYSTEMS: reusable templates, recurring formats, standardized creation processes. The system frees creativity rather than stifling it.

**5. "LinkedIn is a search engine"**
LinkedIn isn't just a social network. It's a professional search engine. Optimizing your profile and content for search (keywords in the headline, about section, posts) is as fundamental as engagement.

### How He Differs from Others
- **Pure B2B**: Doesn't teach tactics for influencers or generic personal branding — focuses on B2B companies with real revenue
- **Carousel expert**: Has the deepest expertise on LinkedIn carousels of any creator
- **Strategic multi-platform**: LinkedIn + YouTube + Google as an integrated ecosystem, not isolated platforms
- **Practical and template-driven**: Offers ready-to-use templates and frameworks, not just theory
- **ROI-focused**: Measures success in leads and revenue, not vanity metrics

## Frameworks and Methodologies

### 1. The Carousel Mastery Framework

**Why carousels work on LinkedIn:**
1. **High dwell time**: The user swipes between slides — spends more time on the content — the algorithm rewards it
2. **Maximum screenspace**: In US Letter format, the carousel takes up maximum space in the feed
3. **Interactivity**: The swipe is an active action — positive signal for the algorithm
4. **Saves**: Educational carousels get saved much more than text posts
5. **Shares**: Well-made visual content gets shared more easily

**The rules for the perfect carousel:**

**Slide 1 — The Cover (the visual hook)**
- Large, readable, specific title
- Maximum 8-10 words
- Must work as a hook: the reader must want to swipe
- Include: number + clear benefit
- Example: "5 mistakes costing your SMB candidates"

**Slides 2-N — The Content**
- ONE concept per slide (never two)
- Large, readable text (minimum 24pt)
- Max 50-60 words per slide
- Clear visual hierarchy: title — subtitle — body
- Generous white space
- Arrow or "swipe" indicator on the first slides

**Final Slide — The CTA**
- Summarize the value in 1 sentence
- Clear CTA: "Save for later," "Comment with your experience," "Follow me for more content"
- Never a link on the slide (put it in the post or comment)

**Technical specs:**
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Ideal format | US Letter (816 x 1056 px) or 4:5 |
| Number of slides | 8-12 (sweet spot) |
| Minimum font | 24pt |
| Recommended tool | Canva |
| File format | PDF |
| Max words/slide | 50-60 |

> *Example for a B2B brand*: Carousel "Keyword Matching vs AI Reasoning in 5 Differences" — Slide 1: hook title, Slides 2-6: one difference per slide with visual comparison, Slide 7: "Which approach do you use?" (engagement CTA). This type of carousel generates high reach + saves + comments.

### 2. The B2B Content Strategy Framework

**How to structure a LinkedIn content strategy for B2B companies.**

**Layer 1 — Foundation (Profile)**
- Company profile and personal profiles optimized as landing pages
- Strategic keywords in headline, about, experience
- Banner that communicates the value proposition
- Featured section with lead magnet or case studies

**Layer 2 — Regular Content (3-5 posts/week)**
- Mix of formats: carousel (2x/week), long text (1-2x), video (1x)
- Content pillars: educational (40%), storytelling (25%), opinion (20%), promo (15%)
- Every post has a clear objective: awareness, engagement, or conversion

**Layer 3 — Lead Generation**
- Lead magnets tied to content (guides, templates, checklists)
- CTA in the first comment (never in the post)
- Sequence: value content — lead magnet — email nurturing — demo

**Layer 4 — Amplification**
- Employee advocacy: employees share and comment
- Strategic engagement: commenting on target decision makers' posts
- Paid amplification of top organic performers

> *Example*: For a B2B/SaaS brand, the weekly strategy: Monday = educational carousel, Tuesday = founder text post, Wednesday = short video, Thursday = how-to carousel, Friday = storytelling/behind the scenes post. Lead magnet tied to the Monday carousel.

### 3. Carousel Templates for B2B

**The 5 carousel templates that work in B2B:**

**Template 1 — "X Mistakes [Target] Makes"**
- The top performer overall
- Structure: cover — 1 mistake per slide — final CTA slide
- Works because: the target wants to know if they're making them
- Example: "7 screening mistakes that cost you the best candidates"

**Template 2 — "X vs Y" (Comparison)**
- Compares two approaches, methods, or tools
- Structure: cover — 1 difference per slide — conclusion
- Works because: polarization generates engagement
- Example: "Manual screening vs AI reasoning: 5 differences"

**Template 3 — "How to [Do X] in [N] Steps"**
- Practical how-to, immediately actionable
- Structure: cover — 1 step per slide — summary
- Works because: practical value generates saves
- Example: "How to screen 200 resumes in 3 hours (5 steps)"

**Template 4 — "The [N] Lessons from [Experience]"**
- Insights extracted from a real experience
- Structure: cover with context — 1 lesson per slide — conclusion
- Works because: combines storytelling + practical value
- Example: "5 lessons after analyzing 10,000 resumes"

**Template 5 — "The Future of [Industry]"**
- Trends and predictions
- Structure: cover — 1 trend per slide — implications
- Works because: generates comments (agreement/disagreement)
- Example: "The future of recruiting: 5 trends for 2026"

## How to Apply to Your Brand

### 1. Carousels as a signature format

Carousels should be the primary format (at least 2/week):
- Maximize reach and dwell time
- Perfect for educational industry content
- Highly saveable and shareable
- Lend themselves well to infotainment tone (visual + short text + humor)

**Carousel plan for a B2B brand:**
- Monday: Educational carousel (mistakes, best practices, how-to)
- Thursday: Industry carousel (trends, data, comparisons)
- Recurring templates with brand visual identity

### 2. LinkedIn as a search engine

Optimize for search:
- Industry keywords in founders' headlines
- Keywords in posts (in the text, not just in hashtags)
- About section optimized with terms the target searches for

### 3. Template system for consistency

Use the 5 carousel templates as a recurring system:
- Each month, produce at least 1 per template
- Don't reinvent the format — only reinvent the content
- Templates = consistency, consistency = growth

## Hook and Virality Techniques

### How He Captures Attention with Carousels

**1. The cover with number + pain point**
- The number promises concreteness, the pain point promises relevance
- *Example*: "5 reasons you're losing candidates (without knowing it)"

**2. The cover with a provocative question**
- A question the target can't ignore
- *Example*: "Is your selection process still stuck in 2015?"

**3. The cover with a shock data point**
- A surprising number that creates curiosity
- *Example*: "73% of resumes get discarded without being read"

**4. The "tease" on the first slide**
- A preview of the most interesting content
- *Example*: "#4 will surprise you (it surprised us too)"

### Recurring Patterns
1. **Hook cover — Slide-by-slide content — Final CTA**: The standard carousel pattern
2. **Data point — Explanation — Implication**: For data-driven carousels
3. **Problem — Steps — Result**: For how-to carousels

## Core Philosophy

### The 5 Fundamental Principles

**1. "The hook gets you in the room. The re-hook slams the door"**
On LinkedIn, you have 3 visible lines before "see more." The hook (first line) captures attention. The re-hook (second/third line) eliminates any reason to scroll away. Together, they decide whether the post gets read or ignored.

**2. "Write your last line first"**
The most powerful line in a post is often the last one. But most people waste it. The trick: write the conclusion FIRST, then build the post that leads to that conclusion. This reverses the creative process and makes every post more impactful.

**3. "Position your thoughts as facts"**
Don't write "I think maybe keyword matching doesn't work well." Write "keyword matching doesn't work." Confidence in writing conveys authority. People follow those with strong opinions, not those with doubts.

**4. "One idea, one post"**
Every post must have ONE clear message. Not three insights, not five lessons. One. If you have 5 ideas, you have 5 posts. Clarity is the prerequisite for virality.

**5. "Signposting > Bragging"**
Don't say "I'm an expert in X." Prove it through your content. "Signposting" is the art of letting your expertise emerge naturally, through the stories you tell and the frameworks you share, without ever having to proclaim yourself an expert.

### How He Differs from Others
- **Pure copywriter**: while others teach "LinkedIn strategy," Alic teaches HOW TO WRITE — the foundational skill
- **Show don't tell embodied**: every one of his posts is a practical demonstration of the technique he teaches
- **Hook obsessed**: no one has studied and systematized LinkedIn hooks like him
- **Exceptional free resources**: shares detailed frameworks for free (PDFs, cheatsheets, guides)
- **Cross-platform applicable**: his copywriting techniques work on any platform, not just LinkedIn

## Frameworks and Methodologies

### 1. The Hook Framework — The 3 Lines That Decide Everything

**The context**: On LinkedIn, the feed only shows the first 3 lines of a post. If those 3 lines don't capture attention, the post dies. The hook is the #1 skill on LinkedIn.

**Line 1 — The Hook (captures attention)**

Types of hooks that work:

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Bold statement** | [Strong, clear statement] | "Keyword matching is dead." |
| **Number hook** | [Number] + [surprising result] | "200 resumes. 3 hours. Zero candidates lost." |
| **Question hook** | [Question the target can't ignore] | "How much time do you waste every week on screening?" |
| **Contrarian hook** | [Opinion against the consensus] | "ATS hasn't improved recruiting." |
| **Curiosity gap** | [Partial information that creates curiosity] | "I discovered why 73% of recruiters get screening wrong." |
| **Story hook** | [Start of a story in medias res] | "It was 6:30 PM on a Friday. 200 resumes. Zero shortlist." |

**Hook rules:**
- ONE line. Never two
- Short. Max 10-12 words
- Specific. No generalities
- Strong stance. No "maybe," "I think," "could be"

**Line 2 — White Space**
- After the hook, blank line
- Creates a visual pause
- The eye "falls" into the next line
- It's a visual trick but it works

**Line 3 — The Re-Hook (eliminates the objection to scrolling)**

The re-hook answers the reader's unconscious question: "Why should I keep reading?"

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Promise re-hook** | "Here's [what you'll get]" | "Here are the 5 mistakes nobody tells you about." |
| **Credibility re-hook** | "[Proof you know what you're talking about]" | "I learned this after 10,000 screenings." |
| **Stakes re-hook** | "[What you lose if you don't read]" | "If you don't fix this, you're losing candidates every day." |
| **Teaser re-hook** | "[Preview of the content]" | "#3 surprised me the most." |

> *Example for a B2B brand*:
> Hook: "73% of resumes get discarded without being read."
> [space]
> Re-hook: "And the perfect candidate? Probably in that 73%."

### 2. The Perfect LinkedIn Post Structure

**Anatomy of a high-engagement post:**

```
[HOOK — 1 line]

[RE-HOOK — 1-2 lines]

[BODY — the post's value]
- Use short sentences
- One idea per line
- White space between concepts
- Lists when possible
- Specific numbers > generic statements

[POWER CLOSE — the memorable closing line]

[CTA — the question or action]
```

**The Power Close:**
- The last line of the post must be memorable, quotable, shareable
- It's the line the reader takes with them
- It's often the line you should write BEFORE everything else

**The rhythm rule:**
- Short sentences (3-8 words) for impact
- Medium sentences (8-15 words) for explanation
- Never long sentences (20+ words) — break them up
- Alternate short and medium to create rhythm

> *Example*:
> "200 resumes." (short — impact)
> "3 hours of screening." (short — impact)
> "The result? 5 perfect candidates, one of them discarded by keyword matching." (medium — explanation)
> "The problem isn't HR. It's the process." (short — power close)

### 3. "Signposting" — Showing Expertise Without Bragging

**The problem**: How do you demonstrate you're an expert without saying "I'm an expert" (which doesn't work)?

**The solution — Signposting**: Insert "signals" of expertise into content naturally.

**Signposting techniques:**

| Technique | How it works | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Contextual experience** | Insert your experience within the story's context | "After analyzing 10,000 resumes in our first year..." |
| **Proprietary data** | Share data that only an expert would have | "43% of the resumes we analyze contain the phrase 'team player.'" |
| **Original framework** | Teach a framework that's yours, not generic | "The method we use internally has 3 steps..." |
| **Gentle correction** | Correct a common industry misconception | "Many think AI replaces HR. In reality..." |
| **Behind the scenes** | Share the "behind the scenes" | "When we built our system, the first mistake was..." |

> *Example*: Instead of "We're experts in [industry]," write "Last week we analyzed 500 resumes for an 80-person company. The result? 7 perfect candidates in 3 hours. One had been discarded by their ATS." — Signposting: you demonstrate expertise without saying it.

### 4. Alic's LinkedIn Strategies for 2025

**What works on LinkedIn in 2025 (according to Alic's research):**

1. **Text beats images**: Text-only posts often outperform image posts in terms of reach
2. **Video is growing**: LinkedIn is pushing video, but text remains king for engagement
3. **Hook + re-hook is non-negotiable**: The first 3 lines decide everything, more than ever
4. **Comments > Likes**: The 2025 algorithm rewards comments (conversations) more than passive likes
5. **Consistency > Virality**: 3-5 consistent posts/week beat 1 viral post per month
6. **Dwell time matters**: How long people spend reading the post is a signal for the algorithm

## How to Apply to Your Brand

### 1. Irresistible hooks for every post

Every post from your brand must have a studied hook:
- Never start with "We're delighted to announce..."
- Never start with "At [your brand], we believe..."
- Always start with: a data point, a question, a story, a strong opinion

**Hook templates for B2B brands:**
- "[Number] [targets] [surprising action]. Here's why."
- "I [action] [number] times. The result surprised me."
- "[Common process] in 2026? Here's the alternative."

### 2. Signposting for B2B brands

Don't sell directly. Demonstrate expertise through:
- Proprietary data (from your product/service)
- Real client stories (anonymized if needed)
- Original frameworks (that only you can teach)
- Product development behind the scenes

### 3. The hook/re-hook structure for all content

Apply Alic's structure to EVERY piece of content:
- LinkedIn posts: hook + space + re-hook
- Video Reels: visual hook in the first 2 sec + audio re-hook in seconds 3-5
- Carousels: slide 1 = hook, slide 2 = re-hook/promise

## Hook and Virality Techniques

### How He Captures Attention on LinkedIn

**1. The unexpected bold statement**
- Open with a statement that seems wrong or exaggerated
- The reader must think "really?" — clicks "see more"
- *Example*: "The resume is the worst selection tool ever invented."

**2. The number + contrast**
- A concrete number that reveals a gap or an absurdity
- *Example*: "3 weeks of screening. 200 resumes. 1 hire. The ratio is absurd."

**3. The micro-story in 1 line**
- A specific scene that immediately creates an image
- *Example*: "Monday morning, 8:30. 200 resumes on the desk. The CEO wants names by Friday."

**4. The anti-advice**
- "Stop doing X" or "Never do X"
- Generates curiosity: "why not?"
- *Example*: "Stop looking for the perfect candidate. They don't exist."

### Recurring Patterns
1. **Bold hook — Rational explanation — Framework**: "X is dead — here's why — here's the alternative"
2. **Shock number — Context — Solution**: "73% — here's what it means — here's how to fix it"
3. **Common mistake — Correction — New approach**: "Everyone does X — it's wrong — try Y"
